		<description><![CDATA[Wow. Sounds pretty bad. I can&#039;t wait to finally watch it.

I would argue that LEGO Universe wins at un-synergy. While there were those two tiny tie-in sets, the vast majority of the stuff on screen was not buyable or even buildable (the minifig accessories were especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://static2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120203014634/legouniverse/images/c/c4/LEGO_Universe_2012-01-08_10-28-09.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;egregious&lt;/a&gt;).

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the critique. I always enjoy reading these kind of things, and it makes me especially happy when someone brings up how terribly poor TLG&#039;s stories are vs. their timeless products (Bionicle being an exception).
