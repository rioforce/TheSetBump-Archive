		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Nathan! Glad you&#039;re enjoying my writing.

I see where you&#039;re coming from with your comment about the structure of my posts. I&#039;m the kind of person who likes to read reviews of movies before I go and see them so that I can have a critical framework in place to dissect them as I watch, so I naturally write my articles that way. But I can see why other people wouldn&#039;t enjoy that. I&#039;ll keep your comment in mind as I write future articles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree on your comments about Keshen&#039;s video. Your &quot;moving like molasses&quot; description is perfect. I actually was squirming, impatient, as the video progressed. I also agree entirely with David&#039;s comments. When I returned to brickfilming, I binged on a lot of brickfilms and decided to experiment more with exaggerated animation. Previously when I animated I took a more measured approach, but now I attempt a more exaggerated, bouncy look where appropriate, such as during the Half-Life video game sequence in Alex and Derrick: Five Years Later.

I have suggestion on how you might word future &quot;compare and contrast&quot; opinion pieces I&#039;ve seen from you recently. I enjoy these posts a lot, and I know it&#039;s your own opinion that you are presenting, but I would suggest less leading language when introducing the films. I came to the same conclusion as you when I viewed both films, but I do feel like my opinion and experience was effected a bit when watching Addicted to You. I watched expecting to see the slow, sluggish animation, instead of observing it for myself. Simply putting both videos near the top of the post would solve this issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I couldn&#039;t agree more. &quot;Egg&quot; is neat -- I had never seen it before. 

I&#039;m not the biggest fan of &quot;LEGO Black Ops&quot;, but &quot;Addicted to You&quot; could definitely benefit from being about four minutes shorter. The most interesting thing that happens is that tracking shot of the characters holding hands. 

As for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Exaggeration&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;cartoony over emphasis&quot;&lt;/a&gt;...]]></description>
