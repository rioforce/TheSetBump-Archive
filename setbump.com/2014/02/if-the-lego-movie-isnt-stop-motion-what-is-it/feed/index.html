		<description><![CDATA[Huzzah! No one believed me, but I was convinced that the film was CGI and that the credits were stop-motion! I just wish I had someone to gloat this over, but I doubt any of the people with whom I conversed this topic with care anymore. XD  Very cool to learn that my guess was (most likely) right! Good reporting once again from The Set Bump.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My guess seems to be true, CG movie and stop motion credits.

(And &lt;i&gt;technically&lt;/i&gt;, there is stop motion in the Rebrick contest entries featured in the film too.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are some samples of real lego movies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNc3Av9SQhE
I personally think that making a 3d animation of the Lego movie removes its true essence. 
I have this epic idea of remaking the whole &quot;Lego Movie&quot; in actual Legos. 
This will take time but I think it will be an awesome worldwide collaboration!
What do you think? 
Lets collaborate. All Lego stopmotion animators using real legos.
Each participating animators will be given specific scenes. 
Are you up for this challenge real lego stopmotion animators? 
Contact me and lets collaborate.
