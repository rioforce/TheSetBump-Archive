		<description><![CDATA[I love your review, good job David. I&#039;ll go see it again tomorrow and I&#039;ll try to catch that Magic Portal reference. 

Can&#039;t wait to own the DVD! (like you). 

As a father... I got the point of the movie. I&#039;m always keeping my kids away from my studio so they don&#039;t destroy my setup, but thankfully, I&#039;m not Lord Business. They have plenty of LEGO (well, Hero Factory and Duplo) and we play together a lot. Never the less, that part was a message to me (to be careful about how I deal with LEGO and my kids).

And... as a father again... I really know what &quot;We are from planet Duplo and we came to destroy you&quot; means. :-D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great reviews! 
The movie was so touching that my kid could not help but crying, and of course, there was lots of laughing also. BTW, now I can explain to him why the Lord Business has super-tall legs. ^^]]></description>
