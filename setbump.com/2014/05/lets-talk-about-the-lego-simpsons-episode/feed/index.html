		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your “Yellow 4×2 Flat” rating. The actual story was dull and there were too many &quot;Look! We can take apart and rebuild ourselves and our world at will!&quot; jokes. But I did enjoy the &quot;decal&quot; joke and I found all of the cameos and inside jokes hidden in the background a lot more amusing than than most of the front and center jokes.

The LEGO Movie cast a long shadow and definitely made the Simpsons episode look worse in comparison, both in terms of story, jokes and visual appeal (I was quite bothered that the digital LEGO was a pretty poor representation of the actual pieces).

I did like seeing the classic LEGO pirates. I wish The LEGO Movie had included more classic LEGO references beyond Benny and Classic Space.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It was nice, but I won&#039;t buy the DVD unless it comes with an exclusive minfig.
There was good reference for AFOL (The LEGO wooden duck toy in the church), but way less than I expected. I bet some brickfilmer will do better stuff on YouTube now that the Simpsons&#039;s minifigs are out.]]></description>
