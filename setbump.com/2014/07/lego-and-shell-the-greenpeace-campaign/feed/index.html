		<description><![CDATA[What.  I truly have no legitimate response to this.  Honestly, this is just as bad as that time that Muslim group in Austria tried to claim that LEGO&#039;s Jabba&#039;s Palace set was racist and offensive to Muslims.

It&#039;s painfully obvious that Greenpeace are trying to appeal to people&#039;s emotions by making an excessively maudlin, heavy-handed and extremely unsubtle propaganda film based off-of a recent cinematic success to get people to rally against the big nasty greedy corporations who are killing off the poor polar bears.  &quot;Shell is polluting are kids&#039; imagination&quot;.  Just... what?  Is Shell brainwashing kids via LEGO now?  Should I start wearing a tinfoil hat while brickfilming?  Jokes aside, did they even WATCH The LEGO Movie?  Clearly the irony of using TLM as a basis for their crusade is totally lost on them.

I&#039;m actually confused what they&#039;re even protesting about since their petition is so hilariously vague.  How exactly is Shell &quot;polluting imagination&quot;, as they so histrionically put it?  As far as I know, Shell sets have been mainly promotional polybag-type things, and there haven&#039;t been any made for 15 years, as you pointed out.  The Ferrari sets were also limited in number and had nothing directly to do with Shell anyway (did they make the sets because Ferrari is partnered with an oil/gas corporation which very few if any of their target demographic would be interested in?  No, they made it because kids love racing cars.)  This just begs the question of why they&#039;re even picking on LEGO in the first place.  And if they&#039;re going to do it, why not provide some actual factual basis instead of blatantly trying to manipulate people&#039;s emotions in such a half-baked and cringeworthy manner.  The fact Greenpeace don&#039;t even have an apparent clear goal or half-way solid argument to back up their demagogic statements kills off any credibility they have.  Now all we need is a mob with torches and pitchforks besieging Billund (with the torches dipped in non-fossil fuel, naturally).  And finally, what do they even hope to achieve with this campaign?  Will Shell suddenly stop their allegedly unethical business practices because of this?  I highly doubt it.

OK, I probably went off on a massive rant there, but I&#039;m just getting sick and tired of constant fear-mongering with overly emotional messages that just turn me off.  (I&#039;m not even sure why I bothered with such a long post as Greenpeace are probably just trying to stir up controversy and grab attention with this campaign.)  A logical argument backed up with solid facts and reputable research would be much more convincing, but apparently, despite all of humanity&#039;s achievements we still have a limited capacity for rational thought...]]></description>
