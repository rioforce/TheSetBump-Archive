		<description><![CDATA[I never had a chance to check out &quot;LEGO: The Time Machine&quot; until just now, and I have to say, it&#039;s pretty great! As Sir Glub mentioned, the story line and pacing of the film is engaging enough to keep your attention in spite of the more basic stop-motion craft skills. 

And the sets are great! I love the future scene (obviously).

Personally, I&#039;d rather have a film keep my attention at less than 100% animation quality than see a super-slick movie with a lame, boring story -- and the former is what we&#039;ve got here. Well done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;m certainly honored that you featured this on your blog!

I had seen both &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; and &quot;GO MINIMAN GO&quot; prior to making this, and the latter, in particular, did probably serve as a big inspiration though I tried to give my film a different focus.  I made this for a contest, the theme of which was &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, which is why I chose this idea.

Looking over it now, I see several areas for improvement, but given the time span (I had just over a month to make this) and my general inexperience with stop-motion I&#039;m quite pleased with how it turned out.  I did end up re-shooting the Egypt scene as it was extremely flickery, but I&#039;m not sure why it ended up still having loads of flicker despite my best efforts.

Incidentally, I had originally considered using different snippets of music for different scenes (for example, the Egypt scene was supposed to have the Slavonic March, and the pirate/explorer scene the Ride of the Valkyries), and Also Sprach Zarathustra was supposed to be used for the climax, but unfortunately I ran out of time and had to go with a single piece of music.

I certainly intend to continue brickfilming, though at this moment I&#039;m extremely busy. Still, I&#039;ve got several story ideas and am working on scripting, and I hope to work on some projects over the summer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with you on the desire for a more structured approach to teaching brickfilming skills. It&#039;s something David and I have talked about a lot and one of the reasons we started this blog. Definitely keep us informed about your progress on your BrickFilm Workshop. We&#039;d love to cover it here!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a History teacher and a brickfilmer, I love Go Miniman Go. It&#039;s awesome. The Time machine is good too, but need to learn and practice some technics. I think the brickfilmer community need an online class or something to share the basis. I know, there are come post on forums, video and blogs... but they are sometime hard to find or understand. 

People spend so much time on their brickfilm, it&#039;s sad when it come out with lightflicker or shaky cam when it&#039;s an easy thing to fix... if you know about it. I&#039;m working on a BrickFilm Workshop, but it will be in French (as it is not easy for me to write in English). BrickSet had put a lots of reviews about LEGO sets together, maybe the new BrickAnimator can pull together all the ressources about brickfilm in one place? :-)

The time machine commands a lot of respect and I wish they continue brickfilming, they can only improve with time, experiences and... some advice :-)]]></description>
