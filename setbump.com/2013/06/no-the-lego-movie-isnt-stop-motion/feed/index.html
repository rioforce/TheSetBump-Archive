		<description><![CDATA[Well, ignoring the fact that:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We&#039;ve been doing almost &lt;a href=&quot;http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;constant research on this film&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&#039;ve studied animation, LEGO, and stop-motion for 20+ years, and therefore know what stop-motion looks like when I see it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;CG is not yet photoreal enough to pass as stop-motion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anecdotes from the filmmakers are not evidence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All of the behind-the-scenes of The LEGO Movie released thus far feature exclusively CG animation craft and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The folks who wrote the aforementioned articles about The LEGO Movie trailer did, in fact, jump the gun by calling the film stop-motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&#160;
I will concede that the snarky tone of this blog post is, in itself, not terribly productive. Now that a bunch of new behind-the-scenes videos have come out, I&#039;ll write a more constructive follow-up.

If you&#039;ve got other sources or things to contribute to the discussion (beyond just casting aspersions), we&#039;d love to check them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So you&#039;re asking people to do research, but you&#039;re disregarded comments from the people who made the film, because it doesn&#039;t &quot;look&quot; like stop motion?

I hope you realize how hypocritical this article is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually, at Comic Con they confirmed that it is partially real stopmotion and partially CG. However they don&#039;t want anyone to know which parts are real.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not a question of making it stop motion looking. But keeping it true to real world minifigs. I&#039;m glad this CG version has gone for this approach. Minifigs don&#039;t have elbows and knees and I&#039;ve always hated that look in CG renders. 
Some big business involved in this production can&#039;t wait to see the end result.]]></description>
