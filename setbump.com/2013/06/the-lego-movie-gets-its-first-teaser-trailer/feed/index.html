		<description><![CDATA[I was pleasantly surprised by the animation style, for a minute I thought maybe there was some actual stop-motion going on. I fully expect this to be a thoroughly enjoyable romp. 

The prominence of the licensed characters gives me pause. But given the failure of LEGO Universe, I guess we can&#039;t blame them for eschewing a LEGO-specific mythos...

I am happy to see a black minifig co-existing with yellow minifigs for the first time since Cloud City. If I can&#039;t buy that Morgan Freeman minifig, I will be very disappointed.]]></description>
