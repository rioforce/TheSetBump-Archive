		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve actually seen 3 of those I forgot about them :3
But thank you for directing me towards Robota!  That was a super cool short.  

If you wouldn&#039;t mind checking out my animation, I&#039;d love to hear what you think about it!  It&#039;s called &quot;Breaking the Fourth Wall&quot;
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w0R2QyffTI

It&#039;s my first real animation I&#039;ve ever done :)  I&#039;m not too proud of the sound design but I really don&#039;t know much about that stuff..  But I&#039;d love to here what you think!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree it&#039;s a great time to animate!  I used to make animations with that old Steven Spielberg Moviemaker set, and I loved it!  But now, with even more technology and great software and great quality webcams for a low price, anyone can animate!  I know I wouldn&#039;t have been able to make my lego-movie without the new technology :)

Does anyone happen to have a must-see list of Lego animations?  The only ones I&#039;ve seen that I would consider legitimate short-films are Lindsay Flea&#039;s &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; and Maxime Marion&#039;s &quot;Droits d’auteur&quot;.  As much as I enjoy watching little lego comedy sketches by people like Keshen8 and SpastikChuwawa, sometimes I want a little bit more substance :P]]></description>

The bottom line, though, is that more people than ever are trying their hand at LEGO animation. As far as I&#039;m concerned, this can only be a good thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree! It is a lot easier and sometimes more popular to go with a pre-existing universe of characters and themes that are already recognized by the masses. These type of videos fit the internet well and are those that are easily &quot;shared&quot; around and enjoyed. However, I prefer watching an original film than one based off someone else&#039;s content, like those that you listed. Thanks for bringing that up and for your comments!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Delighted to have this as our first guest post! I couldn&#039;t agree more with the sentiment. 

I feel very lucky to have been born when I did. I was lucky that my family had a camcorder when I was a kid, which is what I used to make my first LEGO videos. They were just really starting to drop in price and become widely available around then. 

YouTube also launched right when I was in college so I was able to start building an audience then. Thinking about YouTube distribution really affected how I wrote and filmed The Nightly News at Nine. 

Yay for the modern era!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice to see a different take on this discussion.  I agree; I think the main problem here is that as the technology has become cheaper and more accessible and the rise of YouTube, many more people are making and releasing mediocre brickfilms--making it harder to find the good work.  But that doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t any big, high quality films being made (France &#038; Alex&#039;s &quot;Bestia&quot;, your highlighting of &quot;Bound&quot;, NickDurron&#039;s Kickstarter pitch for &quot;Melting Point&quot;, and Squid&#039;s Batman Brickfilm all come to mind).  Not only that, but there are some great new animators out there (Brotherhood Workshop, though to be fair, they&#039;ve mostly released LotR-based shorts, but very high-quality and funny ones at that) and old, &quot;retired&quot; animators are coming back (Nathan Wells).

If anything, this is good news, as Brickfilming is now becoming more popular and recognised as a hobby.  Hopefully new animators will in time become better and release longer, higher quality films.  I myself have only just begun and still have much to learn.

One issue I think, though, is creativity.  The brickfilms that become the most popular are invariably based on licensed themes (Star Wars, Batman, etc.) or existing material (such Insomniac&#039;s music videos).  The bulk of the work produced by the most famous/popular brickfilmers (ForrestFire, Keshen, Brotherhood Workshop) especially follows this trend.  Fancypants&#039; most popular video is a lightsaber duel.  Even Michael Hickox tends to tap into the average person&#039;s perception of LEGO--as a children&#039;s toy, telling stories in a simple, almost nostalgic way.  There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with this (Insomniac&#039;s music videos are incredible, The Force Unleashed is rightly a textbook case on how to film a fight scene, Brotherhood&#039;s films are hilarious and well executed, and your own &quot;Don&#039;t Blink&quot; film was very nicely done) but it does point to a tendency to rely on other people&#039;s creativity to get popular.  It&#039;s to a certain extent understandable--using something popular and recognizable (like Batman) will reach a much larger audience (I suspect this is why Superman and Batman are going to be in The LEGO Movie...), but it makes original, stand-alone stories told using LEGO as the medium much more difficult to bring to a larger audience.  I doubt many outside of the brickfilming community are familiar with, say, &quot;The Citizen of the Year&quot;, &quot;The Call of Farqunglu&quot;, &quot;Zombie: Genesis&quot;, &quot;Unrenewable&quot;, &quot;Copyright&quot;, or &quot;Pirates Rule!&quot;; which is a shame, as these sort of films are by far more interesting than a short clip of Batman fighting Stormtroopers.  Sadly, all this will most likely encourage most brickfilmers to make clips about licensed characters, instead of creating their own unique stories.

Well, I went a bit off-topic there, sorry for the overlong post.  I enjoyed this article; it&#039;s nice to see a different writer on The Set Bump!  (Not that I have anything against Pickett and Pagano, of course!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s funny that you mention Loïc F-B’s “The Good Old Days”, as I was actually considering referencing it in this post! As I was drafting the article I immediately thought of his film when I came to the portion about the &quot;golden age&quot;. We must remember to take what we have today and use it.

Also, great point about the LEGO Movie! It&#039;ll be exciting to see what happens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is more and more brickfilms on the internet, that&#039;s for sure. But considering the age and the goal of many new brickfilmers, I would say that The LEGO Group reaches its target: young boy 5 to 12 years old.

Those kids publish every 2 sec of animation they do and they are so proud of it. That&#039;s the way people learns: by trying. So, I wouldn&#039;t say their is a bunch of bad brickfilms on internet, I prefer to say that their a lot of people out there trying and learning, becoming better movies after movies. That&#039;s how I started and I can tell you that&#039;s how every great film maker started.

 Jackson, this blog post is awesome and I agree with you. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great job on your first article! It was as enjoyable to read as your blogs. It really has never been a better time to be a brickfilmer. Personally I think that when the new Lego Movie comes out it&#039;ll draw more people to watch brickfilms. Is it just me or do legos seem to becoming cooler to the world as time goes by

		<description><![CDATA[Obviously the more brickfilm there are, the more mediocre brickfilms there are. (And therefore more good brickfilms too.)
Just like you I don&#039;t think this is a bad time for brickfilming.
And with &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; coming we should expect more newcomers in brickfilming, it&#039;s not going to stop now.
To those who says that the golden age is over, I&#039;d tell them to watch Loïc F-B&#039;s &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, which fits pretty well to the situation.
Everyone has its own &quot;golden age&quot;, in a few year brickfilmers will look back at 2013 and think that this was the golden age.
Isaac Asimov wrote an interesting essay about that.]]></description>
