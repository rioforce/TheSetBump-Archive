		<description><![CDATA[Maybe you should start a festival in the UK. I&#039;m sure there are many animators and fans who would appreciate it :)

BrickFlix does indeed accept submissions from anyone. For instance, I&#039;ve never attended, but my videos have played there every year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, why do all of the brickfilming conventions and festivals take place in the USA?  For those of us living Across the Pond (or anywhere else in the world for that matter) this is a rather unfortunate set of circumstances.  Alas, I lack the disposable income to make the epic journey to North Carolina (and unfortunately I don&#039;t think I could convince anyone that funding said journey would be a worthwhile cause).

Anyway, I noticed that the playlist had some films on it made by people who didn&#039;t attend (or weren&#039;t on the Q&#038;A panel)--does this mean you can submit your films even if you don&#039;t attend in person?]]></description>
