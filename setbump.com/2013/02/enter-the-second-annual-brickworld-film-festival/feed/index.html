		<description><![CDATA[Mighty Wanderer- You bring up some excellent questions. Here are some options you may want to consider:

1) You and your family might want to think about just attending Brickworld Chicago as public attendees on either Saturday or Sunday. You won’t be able to enter the contest, but you will be able to meet David and I (and other animators present) and watch the animations (we’ll have them playing on a loop during the public hours, in addition to showing them on Saturday evening for the festival screening). You’ll also be able to see all the cool LEGO exhibits.

2) All Access Registrants can attend the film festival screening on Saturday night.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Man, we&#039;re going to be right in the neighborhood during the dates of Brickworld, but I&#039;m not sure if I want to spend $70, since all I really want to do is attend/compete in the film festival and maybe meet some fellow brickfilmers. :/]]></description>
