		<description><![CDATA[Some neat stuff and good sound design. I agree with everything that&#039;s been said here.

(Also, note the irony of having the &quot;LEGO In Real Life&quot; title graphic as the only thing not made out of, er, LEGO in real life.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you hit the nail on the head here. There aren&#039;t many other examples to compare it to, but I think Paint. by CheesyBricks managed to transcend the PES influence. However, I do find a close imitation less egregious when it&#039;s a style that is still barely explored in brickfilming. I would love to see them use this as a starting point and really come into their own with the concept in a future film, but as it stands it is a neat piece of work, especially the milk animation.]]></description>
