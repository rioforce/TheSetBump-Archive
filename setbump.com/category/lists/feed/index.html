				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As writers of <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com">the Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild</a> Brickfilming News and Events Blog, we are constantly searching the internet for brickfilming news. We discovered that a few types of brickfilms get more online news coverage than others. <span id="more-1481"></span> There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much online news coverage about the average typical brickfilm.  There&#8217;s also not much coverage about fan made superhero or Star Wars brickfilms. Online news coverage, along with the views, generally goes to brickfilms that are: 1) recreations of movie trailers, 2) video game inspired, 3) sports re-enactments, 4) music videos of songs from popular artists, 5) marriage proposals, and 6) all the PR stuff about LEGO sponsored/produced CGI animations like Batman, Star Wars, and the upcoming LEGO Movie.</p>
<p>To narrow things down, let&#8217;s just look at the genre of brickfilm movie trailers. Movie trailers done as brickfilms are typically animated frame for frame to the existing original trailer&#8217;s soundtrack. I found nine movie trailers recreated in LEGO to examine and showcase.</p>
<p>1) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=c57lVldtENw">The Heat</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/grey4484">Garrett Barati</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c57lVldtENw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of Garrett Barati and I love this brickfilm movie trailer. The animation is very realistic and true to the original trailer. All of the props and scenery in the backgrounds give such depth to each scene. I especially like the floor patten in the police jail scene, simple with a nice addition. The real movie Heat had decent success at the box office, but the recreated version doesn&#8217;t have many views. It surely deserves more than it has right now. Perhaps the R rating hurts the potential audience that appreciates brickfilms.</p>
<p>2) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsCigaRp-o">Wolverine</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ugsCigaRp-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Antonio Toscano has his niche in brickfilming. It&#8217;s making brickfilm movie trailers. He has found success in his brickfilm movie trailers as he has over a million views between his four trailers. &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; is Toscano&#8217;s most recent brickfilm movie trailer and is the first of four on this list of nine brickfilm trailers.  It currently has just over 10,000 views on YouTube. The sets and the lighting are all good and the energy of the animation totally works for the brickfilm trailer. The animation is a bit little choppy at times, but doesn&#8217;t distract or take away from this great brickfilm.</p>
<p>3) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7JGT0yxxMw">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7JGT0yxxMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This one is my favorite of Antonio Toscano&#8217;s brickfilm movie trailers. Maybe I just have a fondness for Star Trek. The micro-scale that was used in some of the scenes worked well. The trailer had a great selection of the minifigures. An <a href="http://www.itworld.com/internet/348999/mash-gold-star-trek-trailer-meets-lego">article about Toscano&#8217;s trailer</a> was written by ITWORLD.</p>
<p>4) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFLoAa00NFs">Lego Man of Steel Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bFLoAa00NFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video has over a quarter million plus views on YouTube. It stays very true to the original trailer. There are a few issues with the animation here and there, but like some of the other Toscano&#8217;s brickfilms, it doesn&#8217;t hurt the energy of the recreation. <a href="http://entertainment.msn.co.nz/blog.aspx?blogentryid=1082918&amp;showcomments=true">EntertainmentFIX</a> and <a href="http://www.unleashthefanboy.com/news/man-of-steel-trailer-in-lego-glory/41076">Unleash the Fan Boy</a> wrote blogs about this video.</p>
<p>5) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO4fP1DwBeo">Iron Man 3 Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mO4fP1DwBeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This brickfilm recreation is closing in on one million views. It&#8217;s loaded with extensive chroma keying that&#8217;s well achieved. The scene with the helicopters attacking Tony Stark&#8217;s home was the scene that worked best for me. Toscano had fun with this one. There are a few easter eggs that are hidden in the film. I also like Toscano&#8217;s style of making explosions with special effects. The explosions have a realness to them as they are not just keyed in explosions from <a href="http://www.detonationfilms.com/">Detonation Films</a>, the explosions use real bricks in the effects.</p>
<p>6) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF7S3bSltTs">The Dark Knight Rises TRAILER#1 in LEGO!</a>&#8220;by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EF7S3bSltTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first of the movie trailer recreations that have earned over one million views. It&#8217;s brilliantly done with great animation, lighting, special effects, and incredible CGI scenes. My complaint with this trailer has everything to with the original trailer, not Forrest Whaley&#8217;s recreation. There&#8217;s not enough Batman, I think he&#8217;s in only one scene. I want to see BATMAN! You can always count on Forrest for top notch brickfilms.</p>
<p>7) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5Zf7aol3oM">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 TRAILER</a>&#8221; in LEGO by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O5Zf7aol3oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a first class professional grade recreation and my favorite of the two Forrestfire101 trailers on this list. It has great special effects, great lighting effects, and is also incredibly well animated. Forrest did not rely on CGI like his Dark Knight Rises Trailer. Forrest might be the king of college age humor using LEGO animation, but he can also make top notch movie trailers in LEGO. Kudos Forrest! It&#8217;s also great to be able to share a few of his brickfilms with our young daughter.</p>
<p>8) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEwUwslyaEQ">Dark Knight Rises Trailer 3: IN LEGO</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ParanickFilmz?feature=watch">ParanickFilmz</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dEwUwslyaEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a very well done recreation, and must have taken ages to make. Some of the scenes rely on CGI and have a less of an authentic feel compared to the stop motion scenes. The mouth movements and facial animation are also well done. The lighting and special effects were superb. <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/watch-the-third-dark-knight-rises-trailer-recreated-with-lego/">Comic Book Creation</a> posted an article about this trailer.</p>
<p>9) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6PPvUhR4c&amp;list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&amp;index=9">Cars 2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PatrickBoivin?feature=watch">Patrick Boivin</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&#038;index=8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Patrick Boivin is a professional stop motion artist and it shows. Although he doesn&#8217;t work with LEGO for most of his animations, the Cars 2 Trailer that he created is one of the most impressive brickfilms that I have ever seen. This jaw dropping trailer was released back in 2011 and now has over ten million views. It was a paid commission work from LEGO, Disney, and Pixar. Mr. Boivin was not completely alone on this project. He had the benefit of getting help from a &#8220;builders team at LEGO&#8221; on the scenic elements. I wish I had a team like that for my brickfilms. The &#8220;facial&#8221; animations are top notch and don&#8217;t seem like some painted on effect done in post production. Folks, it doesn&#8217;t get any better than this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjM9cEg2nbM">Barney&#8217;s cherry</a>&#8221; in the Eurobricks <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showforum=120">Brick Flicks and Comics forum</a> last weekend, I started wondering why animations starring Fabuland characters are so frequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">Lynchian</a>. Considering Fabuland was originally marketed at children ages 4-8, there is an alarmingly high occurrence of hallucinatory imagery, adult language, and graphic violence in these animations. There aren&#8217;t many Fabuland animations to begin with, so this list could also be called &#8220;The 7 Best Fabuland Animations,&#8221; but ranking them in order of weirdness is a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>1) &#8220;Mein Herz [My Heart]&#8221; by Pawnshop Orchestra (2006)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oGoXydXBwCo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This music video is probably the most straightforward Fabuland animation out there. A cat and a goat are in love, but far apart. The goat overcomes distance and an octopus to be reunited with his true love. Short, sweet, and barely weird.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; by FilmFair (1987)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dGFFmcu6mTc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>&#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; was an officially licensed series to promote the Fabuland sets. However, rather than using actual Fabuland products, the characters are made of clay, allowing for a much greater range of expression. This series is standard kid show fare; each episode presents a small challenge that is overcome in a friendly manner. The only weirdness here is intrinsic to the Fabuland product line: it takes place in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry">Scarreyesque</a> village of anthropomorphic animals. But as we all know, overly-cheerful facades often harbor horrible secrets. (There are plenty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEC4389AD9D69F3D">more episodes</a> for those who want more.)</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.nifeislife.com/orzoro-soluble-120g-p-777.html">Nestlé Orzoro</a> Commercial (1985)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-ixHXylZ8?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>In this frenetic 15-second commercial, a pig and a panda pull back a curtain to reveal a forest. In the forest, six Fabulanders pop out of a tree and wave before disappearing again. But the forest was just another curtain! Some characters fly through the air to place logos! Another curtain! Oh look, it&#8217;s the product! How did the pig get trapped inside? No time to worry about that, he&#8217;s saved by a parrot on a trapeze! Another curtain, everybody bows! What was that commercial about?</p>
<h3>4) &#8220;Barney&#8217;s Cherry&#8221; by Thauka Kuki Team Entertainment (2012)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TjM9cEg2nbM?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Even after watching this film half a dozen times, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite &#8220;solved&#8221; it. This animation is very clearly a riddle on multiple levels. Firstly, there is the riddle presented via intertitles, which the viewer is given time to ponder before being presented with an answer. However, that answer doesn&#8217;t really satisfy, and it&#8217;s clear that there are visual clues throughout that point to the real solution (the very first titlescreen makes sure we know this).</p>
<p>But even after I figured out that (highlight to reveal spoilers) <span style="color: #ffffff;">Bonnie is cheating on Ed with Barney and actually wanted to free Barney, but was tricked by the statues watering the flowers</span>, I still don&#8217;t understand why the horses on the side of the screen turn into different animals at 0:47, why the characters spend so much time looking at the sword and cherry, or what random flashes of light are all about. But because the film is well animated and has a good score, I don&#8217;t mind revisiting it again and again.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning: the following films contain objectionable content</span></h2>
<h3>5) &#8220;A day in the life of&#8230;&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/complessogasparo?feature=watch">Complesso Gasparo</a> (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vRNJCcnNvEQ?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Following the advice of a real-life chihuahua, a Fabuland monkey breaks the shackles of his buttoned-down life. He then proceeds to break-dance everywhere, deface a wall with obscene graffiti, take off his head, and attack a pig on a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>6) &#8220;The Franky Job&#8221; by David M Pickett (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSApqbyCJM4?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Rather than review my own film, I&#8217;m going to quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>&#8216; Bricks in Motion <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/films/view/126/">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s essentially a noir private-eye film, but at its core is laced with hidden subtexts of racism and bigotry. The film is at times humorous, thought-provoking, and disturbing, mixed together in a blend that would seem abstract (and is for the most part), but seems to come together somehow at the end.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) &#8220;Fabuland&#8221; by Grégory Métay et Olivier Couëllant (2000)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OsZAu0Y_LBo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This is the quintessential Fabuland animation and deserves 10 times as many views as it has. It features the most fully realized busy Fabuland town, and music and voice acting that perfectly fit the style of the characters. There&#8217;s a lot to admire here from  an animation perspective; the swaying palm trees are my personal favorite. Despite not knowing French, I felt like I understood the story perfectly thanks to the great visual storytelling. But why did I put this as the weirdest animation? Let&#8217;s just say it takes some very surprising turns.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: &#8220;<a href="http://brickzone.net/fabuland_housewives.html">The Fabuland Housewives</a>&#8221; by Mark Larson</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" title="Fabuland Housewives by Mark Larson" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg 650w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-268x200.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Though not animated, this hilarious webcomic by Mark Larson is an impressive feat that must have taken countless hours to script, design, photograph, and code. Like the ABC show that inspired it, it is chock full of scandal, gruesome murders, and shocking twists. However, it&#8217;s also uproariously funny and well worth a read if you&#8217;ve got a few hours to kill.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Why are Fabuland animations so weird (or did I exaggerate how weird they are)? Are there any major works I missed?</p>
