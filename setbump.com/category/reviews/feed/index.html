				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello&#8230; what have we here? <span id="more-2882"></span></p>

<p>We still haven&#8217;t seen an official trailer for &#8220;<a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>&#8221; (and it&#8217;s possible <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/01/24/youll-get-a-solo-a-star-wars-story-trailer-when-disney-darn-well-feels-like-it/#4e51d4d84ea3">we never will</a>).</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can whet your appetite with &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97vJOgp3j5E">Lando&#8217;s Deal</a>&#8220;, a wonderful film starring everyone&#8217;s favorite smooth-talking space pirate. I&#8217;ve seen a number of live-action Star Wars fan films, but none of them seem to capture my interest and attention like this one did.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like here—strong cinematography, dynamic blocking and staging, solid sound and voice work, neat bits of animation, and an overabundance of in-camera effects and lighting (the telltale red-and-black <a href="http://www.brickstuff.com">Brickstuff</a> wire is a giveaway). And that&#8217;s basically all ignoring the fact that it&#8217;s a brickfilm; I&#8217;m not even sure that &#8216;the LEGO of it all&#8217; factored into my enjoyment.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s just a simple, fun film, and it feels like Star Wars—you can tell that director Adam Nies has a particular fondness for that old card player / gambler / scoundrel.</p>
<p>And of course, the easiest way to win <em>me</em> over is with a behind-the-scenes video.</p>

<p>The Set Bump, a blog about animation, blogged an animation about an animator experiencing a set bump while animating an animator experiencing a set bump while animating.</p>

<p>I feel obliged to blog it because there are still so few examples of human-scale brickfilms. However, watching this film mostly just made me want to rewatch &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBjLW5_dGAM">Western Spaghetti</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://setbump.com/2015/02/paint/">Paint</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The most impressive parts (brick-built cracking an egg and pouring milk) go by so quickly they are hard to fully appreciate (thank goodness for the 0.25 speed setting on YouTube).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious what others think about this film. Did it feel fresh to you, or a little stale? (Bread puns intended)</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no wonder this delightful comedy won Best Film and Best Screenplay in the 2016 Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild Film Festival. I really like how the living room set gets reimagined for each of the different dimensions they visit. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This excellent brickfilm is a year old, but I was reminded of it after blogging &#8220;<a href="http://setbump.com/2017/07/the-eyes-have-it/">Sheep</a>&#8221; the other day. <span id="more-2746"></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxUXuu73-T8">LEGO Arcade Robot Breakdance Battle</a>&#8221; is the stunning debut brickfilm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhYBiiD4NN1OlhFyVCO9mA">BreakBricks</a> (though not their first stop-motion animation). The animation, lighting, cinematography, and music are all outstanding. The use of replacement animation for the 1&#215;1 eye tiles make the characters really come to life with emotion. Some of those tiles were custom made for this animation, but I don&#8217;t think anyone can hold that against this charming film.</p>

<p>Maxime also goes the extra mile and makes all the sheep blink which not only adds life to the characters but helps hide some of the eye movements and replacements.</p>

<p>In addition to the fantastic character animation, the film has a nice story, excellent lighting and solid sound design.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to follow <a href="http://www.legobatman.com/">Batman</a>? And maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ARp9KBtzP4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I was all set to write a review of &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie&#8221; way back in February, before the film even came out. The first of 2017&#8217;s two sequels to <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a> focused on not only a beloved character from the first film, but on one of <a href="http://fandomania.com/100-greatest-fictional-characters-1-batman/">the most popular fictional characters of all time</a>. Batman is a pop culture institution. So is LEGO. Combining them is a sure thing.</p>
<p>And for the most part, that&#8217;s accurate. The film did well; it&#8217;s got a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_batman_movie/">90% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The product line was robust and full of <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/theme-The-LEGO-Batman-Movie">beautifully designed sets</a> and characters. There was even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Batman-Movie-Making/dp/1465456619">a lovely Making-of book</a> for the film (though it&#8217;s really more a collection of concept art book than it is a comprehensive look behind-the-scenes).</p>
<p>So why did I find it so hard to write anything about this film? Why didn&#8217;t I have the same vigor I had while writing <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">my in-depth review of the first film</a>?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s because a &#8220;LEGO Movie&#8221; is no longer the gamble it once was. This sequel was another fun, well-made film in the LEGO Movie universe, with a great cast and some wonderful designs. But unlike the original, the marketing for this film definitely had the vibe of &#8220;yeah, come on&#8230; we know you&#8217;re all gonna come see this.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, the &#8220;Batman&#8221; of it all is nothing new, either. All of the familiar motifs are here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gang of Gotham&#8217;s worst criminals (led by The Joker, natch) is loose in the city, wreaking havoc and conspiring against our heroes,</li>
<li>The Gotham City government and police force struggle with this excessive amount of crime. And, of course,</li>
<li>Millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat man to clean up the town and work through the pain of losing his parents at a young age.</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper, this might sound like a recipe for a dull film. But as with the first <em>LEGO Movie, </em>what makes it all work is a wonderful dose of humor, self-awareness, and an obvious love for the property. <em>LEGO Batman</em> is definitely a fun watch, and if you liked the original, you&#8217;ll probably like this one, too.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this all means that I don&#8217;t much else to say about <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em> itself. Dave Pickett and I <a href="https://youtu.be/3ARp9KBtzP4">talked at length about it on my YouTube channel</a> back in February (see above), if you&#8217;re interested in some further random discussion.</p>
<p>However, I will say this: I am curious to see what comes next, given the fact that we&#8217;ll have &#8220;<a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/lego-ninjago-movie">The LEGO Ninjago Movie</a>&#8221; to watch and think through a few months from now. As far as IPs go, <em>Ninjago</em> is certainly no <em>Batman</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>You can catch <em>The LEGO Batman Movie </em>on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUI1NPD?ref=dvm_us_tvod_sl_g_TtlM_59|c_201238940585_m_Sjvqe40l-dc_s__">DVD, Blu-ray,</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-lego-batman-movie/id1197505667">iTunes,</a> and elsewhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Bump and the Knight&#8221; by 5-K Animations is less than 2 minutes long, but it establishes a spooky mood in the first two seconds.<span id="more-2638"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tc8TyCxDgM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The opening shot of a microscale castle on a lonely island during a lightning storm immediately sets the tone for what&#8217;s to follow. What really puts it over the top for me is the tilted angle of the camera. The sound, lighting, set design, and cinematography are all working in tandem to create an atmosphere of mystery and unease.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-1024x546.png" alt="" width="700" height="373" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2643" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-1024x546.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-768x409.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-700x373.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The film is full of gorgeous shot compositions. It&#8217;s rare to see a brickfilm with such intimate and thoughtful camera placement.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-1024x543.png" alt="" width="700" height="371" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2650" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-1024x543.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-300x159.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-768x407.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-700x371.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The repeated use of the tilted camera angle keeps viewers on edge right up to the final moments of the film.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-1024x547.png" alt="" width="700" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2645" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-1024x547.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-768x410.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>I also like the open-ending nature of the film. It feels very much like a classic LEGO commercial where it tells just enough of a story to hook the viewer, but let&#8217;s them decide how to continue the story when they <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/6034-1/Black-Monarch-s-Ghost">buy the toy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-1024x547.png" alt="" width="700" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2648" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-1024x547.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-768x410.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p><em>LEGO Life</em> seems to be the replacement for the <em>LEGO Club</em>, the former hub of online LEGO activity featuring games, challenges, videos, and of course, the <em>LEGO Club</em> magazine. With the introduction of <em>LEGO Life</em> comes the introduction of the <em>LEGO Life</em> magazine.</p>
<p>Besides user-submitted content, the app also features officially curated content, most of which comes from LEGO.com. Along with stop-motion videos that were commissioned by the LEGO Group, some of the videos in the Ninjago category are entries to the LEGO ReBrick <em><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/rebrick/contest-page/contests/ninjago-villian-stop-motion">Greatest Villain of all Time in NINJAGO</a> </em>contest—a few of which did not even place in the runner-up category.<a href="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lego-life-brickfilms.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2565 alignright" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lego-life-brickfilms-173x300.jpg" alt="" width="166" height="288" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lego-life-brickfilms-173x300.jpg 173w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lego-life-brickfilms-591x1024.jpg 591w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lego-life-brickfilms.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 166px) 100vw, 166px" /></a></p>
<p>As a pleasant surprise, I noticed that the the app also features the brickfilm classic <em><a href="http://brickfilms.wikia.com/wiki/The_Han_Solo_Affair">The Han Solo Affair</a></em> alongside the more modern animated videos.</p>
<p>Other than that, there unfortunately does not seem to be much stop-motion content within the app. However, now that LEGO has undergone this massive overhaul in their online presence, let us hope that they will bring back the stop-motion aspects once again.</p>
<p><em>LEGO Life</em> is available in some countries for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/lego-life-videos-challenges/id1140466898?mt=8">iPhone and iPad</a>, with an Android version reportedly coming soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite as frustrating as getting trapped in the red tape of a bureaucracy. &#8220;Paragraph&#8221; by golego animation &#038; nichtgedreht illustrates that beautifully.<br />
<span id="more-2535"></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Paragraph&#8221; is a great example of non-verbal communication, the story is told solely through creative visuals and a great soundtrack. One of my favorite moments is when the main character comes to a hallway of colored doors all of which are labeled with a different color. </p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-1024x548.png" alt="" width="700" height="375" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2537" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-1024x548.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-768x411.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The cinematography adds to the feeling of an endless quest through a bureaucracy because it it all one continuos shot on a giant set. The final pull back to reveal all the people endlessly lost, is a fitting ending for a film about a confusing hopeless quest. It also recalls the amazing <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-lego-movie/">end title sequence</a> of &#8220;The LEGO Movie.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, LEGO and PENTATONIX released a 360 video of the Christmas song &#8220;Up on The Housetop.&#8221; It&#8217;s a weird, immersive experience. <span id="more-2481"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T7f_RuGiahs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>360 videos present a unique challenge for the viewer. Do you just watch the default view and trust that most of the action will be there (a safe bet with this particular video)?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2482 size-large" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-1024x594.png" width="700" height="406" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-1024x594.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-300x174.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-768x445.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-700x406.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Do you look around at random things that are potentially not very interesting (like the floor)?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2483" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-1024x574.png" alt="" width="700" height="392" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-1024x574.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-768x431.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-700x392.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Do you watch multiple times looking at various angles trying to find hidden stuff and inadvertently get the song stuck in your head for several days? I know I did.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-1024x570.png" alt="" width="700" height="390" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2485" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-1024x570.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-300x167.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-768x427.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-700x389.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, this video relies more on the gimmick of &#8220;Hey look, it&#8217;s PENTATONIX in LEGO form!&#8221; than the gimmick of &#8220;Hey look, you can spin this video around in different directions to see interesting stuff.&#8221; For an example of a 360 video using LEGO that actually rewards the viewer for looking around, check out this Simpsons / Ghostbusters crossover.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have praised Jon Rolph (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-xwlDpX_96O4ggWH8JmPQ">CheesyBricks</a>) before for his <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/04/addicted-to-egg/">concision</a>. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLAqDKIkgsg">latest animation</a> contains even fewer frames than that 17-second gem.<span id="more-2295"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLAqDKIkgsg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Horse in Motion&#8221; is a mere 15 frames, but oh what a 15 frames they are! Jon Rolph has recreated in LEGO <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/eadweard-muybridge-animal-locomotion-plate-626">one of the most famous image sequences ever</a>. To do so, he used an unusual technique; rather than connecting a bunch of pieces together, he simply arranged unconnected pieces on a flat surface.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this technique before in MOCs (such as this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/xenomurphy/8313941921/in/album-72157640572166663/">Spider-Man mosaic</a>), but I can&#8217;t think of anytime I&#8217;ve seen this in a brickfilm. The closest parallels I can think of are Annette Jung&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/09/annette-jung-strikes-again/">Thriller</a>&#8221; and the Mr. DNA scene in &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2015/04/spared-no-expense/">LEGO Jurassic Park</a>&#8221; by Paul and Hailee Hollingsworth. </p>
<p>I recommend watching &#8220;Horse in Motion&#8221; in high-resolution on a large screen in slow motion. It&#8217;s a lot of fun to look at the unexpected LEGO element Jon sprinkled into the different frames (e.g. a chicken, a hand truck, and a pirate flag).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest episode of the Simpsons, &#8220;Brick Like Me,&#8221; featured our favorite building toy. Did it live up to your expectations? <span id="more-2071"></span></p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t done so already, you can watch the episode on <a href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/631134#i0,p2,d0">Hulu</a> or <a href="http://www.fox.com/watch/245328451690">Fox.com</a> now (or in a week if you don&#8217;t have an account that can unlock it). Once you&#8217;ve watched that come back here and tell us what you thought.</p>

<p>Overall, I would rate the episode a &#8220;Yellow 4&#215;2 Flat&#8221; on the Love Tester in Moe&#8217;s Tavern. There were a few hilarious bits (the scene in the church made me laugh the most, and there were some great pause-or-you&#8217;ll-miss-them puns [<a href="http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/05/05/simpsons-lego-episode-inside-jokes/">here&#8217;s the best round-up of those</a>]), some mediocre bits (&#8220;The Hunger Games&#8221; parody wasn&#8217;t very inspired) and plenty of smile-worthy material in between. </p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons2.png"><img src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons2.png" alt="legosimpsons2" width="1012" height="632" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2074" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons2.png 1012w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons2-300x187.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons2-700x437.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1012px) 100vw, 1012px" /></a></p>
<p>Visually, this episode would have been a lot more impressive if it hadn&#8217;t come out a few months after &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/tag/thelegomovie">The LEGO Movie</a>&#8220;. The CGI is a cut above the style used for Ninjago and Chima (or &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/01/the-adventures-of-clutch-powers-2010/">Clutch Powers</a>&#8220;) and it really is a perfect blend of stop-motionesque CGI and the Simpson&#8217;s existing aesthetic, but it&#8217;s hard not to compare it to the much shinier movie (especially since the episode compares itself to the movie).</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3.png"><img src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3-1024x591.png" alt="legosimpsons3" width="700" height="404" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3-1024x591.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3-300x173.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3-700x404.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/legosimpsons3.png 1114w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>What did you think? Was this episode a sell-out or just great cross-promotion? Did it tickle your funny bone or leaving you feeling flat? Does it count as a <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/is-the-lego-movie-a-real-lego-movie/">&#8220;real&#8221; LEGO movie</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bricktease.com/">Bricktease</a> is well-known for his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQh4hMnxdak">frame-by-frame remake of the opening scene from James Bond&#8217;s &#8220;Casino Royale&#8221;</a>. He also did remakes of some famous movie scenes like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ_uqlNgSU8">&#8220;The Blues Brothers&#8221; car chase</a>. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRfNqvJ264I">latest re-creation</a> is the chestburster scene from &#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078748/">Alien</a>&#8221; (1979).<span id="more-2005"></span></p>
<p>In this brickfilm, there is one thing I would like to share with you, one very simple thing that impressed me a lot (and made me laugh too). Watch it first, then read on.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ZRfNqvJ264I?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The first time I saw &#8220;Alien,&#8221; I was very young and scared. But this remake made me laugh because it&#8217;s so simple.</p>
<p>Did you see it? Bricktease used a simple piece called &#8220;<a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=53989">robot arm</a>&#8221; to impersonate the bursting alien coming out of the poor guy&#8217;s chest. I call that brilliant. Well-animated, a single piece can make you remember a famous character, in a famous scene, in a classic sci-fi movie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for seeing the LEGO Movie last night (spoiler: I really enjoyed it), I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of reviews/previews of the movie and wanted to share some of the most insightful tidbits I&#8217;ve come across.<br />
<span id="more-1937"></span><br />
My illustrious Co-Editor has already written an excellent (though spoilery) <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">review</a>, I won&#8217;t add anything except to once more encourage you to <strong>go see The LEGO Movie</strong>. Once you&#8217;ve done that, come back here for even more coverage dissecting it piece by piece.</p>
<p>One of the few reviews I&#8217;ve seen that actually focuses on the animation style of the film is <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/lets-talk-about-the-animation-in-the-lego-movie-95781.html">this one over at Cartoon Brew</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many films have attempted to break the Pixar-by-way-of-Disney animation mold by suggesting a more stylized approach to animated movement, among them the Madagascar series, Wreck-It Ralph, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. Lego Movie pushes further than any of those films with a consistently inventive style of movement (the key word being consistent).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://io9.com/the-makers-of-the-lego-movie-take-apart-their-creation-1516662564">This feature on io9</a> has some interesting quotes from the directors. Chris McKay, who was in charge of the animation, has nice things to say about brick films:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a charm to those brick films. I think part of that comes with the heart and soul of the filmmaker who comes to the table and wants to create something that is probably beyond their scope&#8230; We wanted the movie to feel like that.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=271142095&#038;ft=1&#038;f=">This NPR review</a> reveals a scene that got nixed:</p>
<blockquote><p>They initially penned a re-education scene for Emmet, with his eyes forcibly held open, after he strays too far from Lord Business&#8217; way of doing things. The Stanley Kubrick reference was deemed &#8220;not perfectly appropriate for family audiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(Don&#8217;t worry, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paganomation/little-guysin-space-a-lego-fan-film-from-paganomat/posts/675959">someone else</a> has got a LEGO version in of that in the works&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-lego-movie-is-another-lovable-effort-from-the--201056">The AV Club review</a> (contains the spoiler) nicely mirrored my own sentiments and Mr Pagano&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only real bone to pick with The Lego Movie is that the gender disparity of the toys themselves—a pervasive criticism of the brand—has carried over to the film’s major characters&#8230; Wyldstyle, though confident and talented, often exists to play the foil of Batman and Emmet. And the only other major female character, voiced by Alison Brie, isn’t portrayed as a mini-figure, making Wyldstyle the catchall female protagonist.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-the-lego-movie-1201082797/">The Variety review</a> helpfully points out how many bricks it would take to build all the stuff shown in the movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if someone had orchestrated the entire experience with plastic toys painstakingly repositioned and photographed one frame at a time&#8230; that would have taken no fewer than 15,080,330 bricks</p></blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP3LP4Bt-NA">behind-the-scenes video</a> is a random collection of footage, but it does shed some light on the animation process: </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xP3LP4Bt-NA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Lest you think all the reviews of the LEGO Movie are effusively positive (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_movie/">though most are</a>), there are some naysayers with some valid points. <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/the-lego-movie-review-will-ferrell-batman">This bit from the Wrap</a> is what resonated with me the most:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while the film’s underlying message about creative independence and playfulness is a strong one, the movie takes a third-act turn (which won’t be spoiled here) that’s bold but ultimately wrong-headed, restating what we’ve already figured out and ruining the delicate balance of this movie’s goofy, click-and-snap universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have more to say on that last bit, but I&#8217;m going to wait a couple days before writing about all my concerns with the movie&#8217;s big twist.</p>
<p>Which reviews have helped you in digesting the LEGO Movie?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can all breathe easy &#8212; <a href="http://www.thelegomovie.com/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a> is actually pretty cool.<span id="more-1870"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1912" alt="emmetawesome" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Here at The Set Bump, we&#8217;ve been keeping tabs on the progress and development of <em>The LEGO Movie</em> for a while, <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/">compiling what morsels of information we could</a> to try and satisfy our curiosity. The announcement of the film <a href="http://variety.com/2009/film/news/warner-builds-pic-with-lego-1118007162/">(waaay back in 2009)</a> left many unanswered questions in our minds &#8212; what would a LEGO motion picture even be about? Would it be <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/06/no-the-lego-movie-isnt-stop-motion/">done in stop-motion?</a> Could it possibly be <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/01/the-adventures-of-clutch-powers-2010/">as boring as <em>Clutch Powers?</em></a></p>
<p>Fear not, dear readers, for we now have answers and so much more. Sound <a href="http://youtu.be/edL_kNErIuw">the spoiler alarm</a> <strong>(I&#8217;m about to spoil pretty much everything)</strong>, and let&#8217;s dive on in.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p><em>The LEGO Movie</em> tells the story of Emmet Brickowski, a construction worker minifig who lives his average life in the average LEGO city of Bricksburg. Using very familiar-looking instruction booklets, Emmet helps build skyscrapers for the Octan Corporation, under CEO President Business.</p>
<p>But President Business has a secret alter-ego: Lord Business, a tyrannical despot with designs to conquer the entire LEGO universe by &#8212; what else? &#8212; gluing everything together.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a group of minifig Master Builders (i.e. our main cast and some licensed supporting cameos) has found the key to foiling Lord Business&#8217; plan: the fabled &#8220;Piece of Resistance&#8221;. Unfortunately, that piece just happens to be glued to Emmet&#8217;s back. And thus, the odyssey begins&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1911" alt="thepiece" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a larger story at work in <em>The LEGO Movie,</em> too (both figuratively and literally), but I&#8217;ll get to that.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is the focal character of the film. Pratt plays the LEGO everyman to a T &#8212; his mastery of goofy charm (refined <a href="http://youtu.be/PeLCx-CXmgM">in his role as Andy Dwyer on &#8220;Parks &amp; Recreation&#8221;</a>) makes him a perfect fit to carry a LEGO film.</p>
<p>Emmet&#8217;s a simple fellow, but his eagerness and sincerity make his adventure a joy to watch. And in the standard &#8220;hero&#8217;s journey&#8221; manner, he picks up a variety of allies along the way&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) is the wise old sage and inveterate foe of Lord Business. Having failed to protect the LEGO universe in the past, Vitruvius foretells of a prophesied chosen one &#8212; &#8220;The Special&#8221; &#8212; who will unlock the key to Lord Business&#8217; eventual defeat.</li>
<li>Wyldstyle, aka Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) is an ambitious and headstrong Master Builder, who&#8217;s actively trying to become The Special by finding the Piece of Resistance. You may remember my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Paganomation/posts/10151541676733201?stream_ref=10">considerable</a> <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/10/preview-the-preview-of-the-lego-movie/">dislike</a> for the name &#8220;Wyldstyle&#8221;; fortunately, it turns out the movie agrees with me (via lots of &#8220;what are you, a DJ?&#8221; jokes at her expense). For better or worse, a lot of Wyldstyle&#8217;s character centers around a sort-of love triangle (a &#8220;like triangle&#8221;?) between her, Emmet, and her current boyfriend&#8230;</li>
<li>Batman (Will Arnett) is the Dark Knight as a hilarious parody; as if the Christopher Nolan films featured Adam West-inspired dramatics. Arnett is perfect in this role, and although much of his funniest material is in the trailer, there is one great sequence where millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne becomes integral to the plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other helpful side-characters include Benny, a 1980s-era LEGO spaceman who REALLY wants to build spaceships; Unikitty, an anime-esque cat/unicorn hybrid with some serious anger issues (and some terrific brick-built alternate faces); and Metalbeard, a giant cyborg pirate who holds Lord Business responsible for his half-minifig, half robot condition.</p>
<p>In the villains&#8217; corner, there&#8217;s really only President/Lord Business (Will Ferrell); his underutilized right hand man, Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson); and an endless supply of robot police, robot feds, robot swat teams, and robot skeletons as cannon fodder for our heroes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1910" alt="robo" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>And then, there&#8217;s &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design of <em>The LEGO Movie </em>is where things really shine; it&#8217;s an amazingly gorgeous film. Every single setting has beautiful detailing and tons of NPU, almost to the point where it becomes distracting. There are dozens of visual nods to LEGO fandom, builder inside jokes, and some great micro-scale gags. Dave pointed some of these out in <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">his review of the trailer</a>, but that&#8217;s really only a small fraction of the insane beauty the filmmakers have packed in. That ocean! (I can&#8217;t wait to pause and frame-by-frame my way through the Blu-ray.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1909" alt="bricksburg" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>For those of you who were worried about the use of computer graphics over stop-motion, I can honestly say that the film does not suffer one bit for it. The framing of many of the shots, as well as the overall texturing and lighting of scenes, really gives you that tactile feeling of being immersed in a brick-built LEGO world. There are one or two shots where the scope of what you&#8217;re looking at belies the film&#8217;s tiny toy-scale nature, but these are few and far between.</p>
<p>In many ways, the design of <em>The LEGO Movie </em>feels like not only a celebration of LEGO products and the hobby as a whole, but also of the craft of animation. Every major animation technique is at work here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stop-motiony quality to the cinematography and character movement really helps set this film apart from things like <em>Clutch Powers</em> and the other CG releases. It&#8217;s super fun, and it <em>feels</em> like LEGO. I&#8217;m sure this approach will inform many stop-motion brickfilms in the future, and I would also have no problem with it becoming the new paradigm for CG LEGO animation. (Please and thank you.)</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also some fantastically fluid 2D facial animation on all of the characters. The CG artists went so far as to give depth to the &#8220;paint&#8221; of the character face designs, as if the faces had been printed on like real LEGO minifigs. As someone who&#8217;s spent hours and hours staring at minifig heads through a macro lens, I truly appreciate this consummate attention to detail.</li>
<li>And then, finally, the CG polish and shine brings everything together.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a fourth filmmaking medium in the film as well &#8212; live-action photography. This was another detail made public by the filmmakers early on, though no one really knew what the implementation of it would be. As it turns out, the live-action sections are where the real story of the film lives.</p>
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>In a broad sense, <em>The LEGO Movie </em>is built around a few overall motifs:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>L</span>EGO creations are not meant to be glued together, but to be continuously rebuilt into whatever cool models a creator can imagine.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to build the greatest creation ever, as long as you&#8217;re building together with the people you care about.</li>
<li>Embrace the things that make you unique.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the main themes as depicted in Emmet&#8217;s character arc; though, as we find out, Emmet is not really the main character of this story.</p>
<p>About 2/3 of the way through the movie, Emmet sacrifices himself by tumbling out of Lord Business&#8217; tower and down into a swirling vortex. Having blacked out, Emmet wakes up to find that he&#8217;s a toy LEGO minifigure in the human world, being played with by a young boy named Finn.</p>
<p>As the live-action scenes unfold, we come to understand that the events of the film up to this point have basically been a dramatization of Finn&#8217;s LEGO playtime scenarios. This makes sense as, earlier in the film, Emmet has a vision of &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;, as illustrated by his mental construction of a distinctly humanoid hand. Additionally, Lord Business&#8217; collection of non-LEGO human-scale artifacts (erasers, band-aids, highlighters, etc.) tells us that the LEGO universe must be somehow tied to our world.</p>
<p>Finn, however, is not &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;. In a further twist (one which I found really enjoyable), it turns out that &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221; is actually Finn&#8217;s father, the real owner of the tables full of LEGO displays that make up the worlds of the LEGO universe. Finn&#8217;s father is quite unhappy, as those LEGO displays are part of his very adult hobby, and are NOT meant to be played with by Finn. When you consider the fact that Finn&#8217;s father &#8212; a businessman in a suit and tie &#8212; is also played by Will Ferrell, the central conflict and meaning of the story becomes unmistakably straightforward. Lord Business&#8217; super-tall legs aren&#8217;t just for show.</p>

<p>(I&#8217;ve heard some comments from fans who question this portion of the film; saying that it&#8217;s a little insulting to AFOLs to be portrayed in such a way. Personally, I thought it was really funny.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at this point that <em>The LEGO Movie </em>becomes not only a action movie for kids, or a toy advertisement, but a fable about the relationship between AFOL and KFOL, parent and child. The film is fundamentally a feature-length <a href="http://www.buildtogether.com/media/videos/#/media/video/3">&#8220;Build Together&#8221; spot</a> &#8212; a series of LEGO TV ads that, perhaps coincidentally, began right around the time this film was announced.</p>
<h3>A Few Gripes</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned the somewhat distracting and complex artistry of the LEGO universe itself. The story, by contrast, is rather simplistic. To be fair, the way that story plays out doesn&#8217;t have a lot of padding or unnecessary scenes &#8212; everything is aptly cut &#8212; but it does feel slightly too fast-paced at times.</p>
<p>Which is crazy, considering the film runs for about 100 minutes in total. (Maybe I&#8217;m just getting old.) Plus, the notion that the entire tale comes from the imagination of a young boy really helps to lampshade a lot of the less satisfying story elements.</p>
<p>Another thing that made me a bit uneasy was the idea of &#8220;The Special&#8221;. I&#8217;m all for empowering kids to use their imaginations, but the word &#8220;special&#8221; is immensely overused in our cultural consciousness. As a concept, it just made me think of that line from &#8220;The Incredibles&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>When everyone&#8217;s super&#8230; no one will be.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, given that the intent here is to embrace those things that make us individually special (and the fact that the prophecy is all but thrown out as malarkey in the third act), I&#8217;m willing to give The Special a pass, too.</p>
<p>The only thing in <em>The LEGO Movie </em>that I couldn&#8217;t find any rationalization for was the utter dearth of female characters. Seriously. Where are all the women?</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve got Wyldstyle as the the only lady character with any real agency, though her role is not much more than that of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend">Action Girlfriend</a>.</li>
<li>Unikitty (Alison Brie) is female, but is technically an animal and not a minifigure. Plus, she doesn&#8217;t come into the film until around halfway through, and even then, her presence is not terribly significant.</li>
<li>Wonder Woman is on the poster, and they went through the trouble of casting Cobie Smulders in the role, but the only thing she does in the film was already shown in the trailer. I honestly can&#8217;t remember if she had more than one line of dialogue in the whole film. (<strong>EDIT 2/16/14:</strong> She speaks literally eight words in the entire film.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask me, an easy solution would have been to cast a woman in the role of Vitruvius. There&#8217;s honestly not much you would have had to change about the character. It&#8217;s great that we now have a recording of Morgan Freeman saying the words &#8220;Taco Tuesday&#8221;, but I would have gladly given that up to have this film pass the Bechdel test. Wyldstyle is essentially Vitruvius&#8217; apprentice, and it could have been interesting to have a female-female relationship stand in contrast to the live-action father-son relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1914" alt="wyldstyle-vitruvius" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Given the recent furor over LEGO Friends, and the fact that a lot of the film&#8217;s tie-in sets include female minifigures, I expected a lot more from <em>The LEGO Movie</em> in that regard. (<strong>EDIT:</strong> I feel like <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2014/01/">this girl</a> might agree with me.) I think I might have cheered aloud when, towards the end, Will Ferrell tells his son that he&#8217;s going to have to let his sister play, too.</p>
<p>(Hilarious Duplo payoff notwithstanding, I don&#8217;t think it would have been too much to ask to actually see the sister on screen, though, even if just for a second. You can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see.)</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>One of the inside jokes of the LEGO fan community is that of the &#8220;Rainbow Warrior,&#8221; a name fondly given to <a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lego-what_it_is_is_beautiful.jpg">those weird-looking multi-colored models we all built as children</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, <em>The LEGO Movie</em> is a bit of a Rainbow Warrior itself. For one thing, it ably tackles the unique problem of tying all the disparate LEGO worlds together; presenting the various play themes as parallel dimensions (and eschewing the nonsensical &#8220;play themes as planets&#8221; approach that <em>Clutch Powers</em> attempted to put forth).</p>
<p>But more than that, it manages to capture the fun, ubiquitous crossover vibe of every child&#8217;s playroom. Batman shooting his grappling hook at the Millennium Falcon in order to steal some spaceship parts from Han Solo and Lando Calrissian? That scene definitely happened in my backyard when I was a kid &#8212; and it happened in this movie, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1916" alt="batmangrapple" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Similarly, I couldn&#8217;t help but react to every pop culture reference and film allusion &#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminator (&#8220;Come with me if you want to not die&#8221;)</li>
<li>The Matrix (Real/dream world analogies, The One, and the &#8220;Think Tank&#8221; room)</li>
<li>Total Recall (The &#8220;Think Tank&#8221; again)</li>
<li>Robocop (&#8220;Where are my pants?&#8221; is this film&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;d buy that for a dollar&#8221;)</li>
<li>Super Mario Brothers: The Movie (Random dancing as a way to disable enemy forces, &#8220;cause everybody loves to dance, that&#8217;s why.&#8221;)</li>
<li>Star Trek (&#8220;The Kragle&#8221; might as well be &#8220;<a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/V'Ger">V&#8217;Ger</a>&#8220;)</li>
<li>Clash of the Titans (&#8220;Release the Kragle!&#8221;)</li>
<li>They Live (The subtle &#8220;Conform!&#8221; propaganda posters, and a few of the skeletal robot feds)</li>
<li>Hot Rod (I kept waiting for Batman to do <a href="http://youtu.be/onU6PGIoeo4?t=7s">this</a> towards the end)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s not even including the official LEGO licenses. In a normal film, such an overabundance of seemingly random references might have felt lazy or unwarranted; but here, they somehow felt justified. I&#8217;ve already referenced &#8220;The Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; in this review, and maybe that&#8217;s all too appropriate &#8212; the minifigure might be the most literal encapsulation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a> ever.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>If I haven&#8217;t made it clear already, I thought <em>The LEGO Movie </em>was really fun, well-made, and an absolute delight to watch. The stunning visuals alone make it worth the price of admission, but the story is efficiently told and has some legitimate stakes, too. It&#8217;s not a perfect film, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned, there&#8217;s something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>Those of us who do LEGO stop-motion (myself included) can admittedly be a bit snobby when it comes to the relationship between CG and &#8220;true&#8221; Brick Animation. When discussing brickfilms in interviews and at workshops, I tend to describe them thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brickfilms are a way for LEGO fans to tell their stories through the use of film and animation techniques. They can use any style, and can be about anything, but they all have one thing in common &#8212; the use of LEGO bricks and elements!</p></blockquote>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, then I think it&#8217;s fair to say that <em>The LEGO Movie </em>qualifies as a brickfilm. Given the nature of the film&#8217;s story &#8212; a child whose imagined LEGO worlds are directly translated into on-screen action &#8212; <em>The LEGO Movie</em> might be the most ambitious, high-concept brickfilm ever. A meta-brickfilm, perhaps.</p>
<p>At the same time,<em> The LEGO Movie</em> also feels like a love letter to the entire brickfilming community. The directors have <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/01/its-official-we-inspired-the-lego-movie/">stated these intentions in interviews</a>, but there was one other fun touch I noticed in the film&#8217;s live-action sequence: the aforementioned swirling vortex that Emmet tumbles down is, in the human world, an over-sized kaleidoscope with the words &#8220;Magic Portal&#8221; written on the side. Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.rakrent.com/mp/">another Magic Portal</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not so important. What IS important is that this film is going to get a lot of people building. And animating. Heck, I left the theater and immediately went to the LEGO store to pick up one of the sets.</p>
<p>Go see <em>The LEGO Movie</em>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of video that reminds me why I make animations with LEGO bricks: because it&#8217;s fun! The camera movement adds a great momentum to the visuals that matches the momentum of the song and the paper backdrops are a lot more appealing than the monochromatic LEGO walls (or baseplates) that often appear in the background of amateur brickfilms.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping we&#8217;ll see more from Tasha R!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the U.S. opening of &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221; just two weeks away, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the &#8220;other&#8221; LEGO movie from a few years ago.<span id="more-1771"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1834" alt="LEGOteam" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587414/">The Adventures of Clutch Powers</a>&#8221; is like so many LEGO CG releases &#8212; a lumbering mass of basic tropes, non-jokes, and now-retired LEGO products (none of which feature the actual main characters of this film). In essence, nothing more than one giant commercial.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s how I remembered it. I hadn&#8217;t seen the film since it was released direct-to-DVD in 2010, after which I immediately retired it to my bookcase for some dust-collecting action. Four years later, <a title="Analyzing the new LEGO Movie trailer" href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">the trailers for The LEGO Movie</a> seem to imply a similar storyline and vibe<em>, </em>so I though I&#8217;d take a second look at <em>Clutch Powers.</em></p>
<p>(Spoiler alert: my memory did not fail me.)</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>The story of <em>Clutch Powers </em>somehow manages to be extremely simplistic and extremely confusing at the same time. Clutch, our main character, is &#8220;the greatest LEGO explorer ever&#8221; (think a blander Indiana Jones/James Bond) and works for LEGO &#8212; which, in this film, is not a toy company but an interplanetary organization that does, um, <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Peg: &#8220;Well&#8230; it&#8217;s about helping others!&#8221;<br />
Brick: &#8220;Fighting the good fight!&#8221;<br />
Bernie: &#8220;Engineering better solutions!&#8221;<br />
Clutch: &#8220;Doing whatever it takes, wherever it takes us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Delightfully vague.</p>
<p>After a throwaway cold open, the LEGO Organization sends Clutch and his team to investigate an incident on a space-prison planet. Finding that the <del>most dangerous</del> only three inmates have escaped, the LEGO crew then heads to a Castle&#8230; planet&#8230; to capture a wizard who had been one of those prisoners. There, Clutch attempts to instill confidence in a young prince, while also learning to work together with the members of his own team, so that they can all stop the wizard from doing&#8230; <em>something. </em></p>
<p>If it seems like I&#8217;m having trouble summarizing what happens in this film, it&#8217;s because I genuinely am. The whole thing plays out like an &#8220;And then&#8230;&#8221; screenplay written by a 6-year-old &#8212; not in a good way, like <a href="http://axecop.com/">Axe Cop</a>, but just the type of scenario a child might come up with while playing with some assorted LEGO kits. &#8220;And then MALLOCK THE WIZARD escapes from SPACE PRISON and they have to go to the CASTLE PLANET OF ASHLAR to catch him before he gets the GOLDEN SWORD OF KING REVET and takes over the whole world etc.&#8221; Insert spaceship swooshing noises here.</p>
<p>At the same time, the thinness of the plot is undermined further by some pretty obvious plot holes and contradictions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the LEGO Organization gets a distress call from the prison planet, the video footage shows Space Police officers who literally exclaim, &#8220;the prisoners are escaping!&#8221; Clutch and his team then proceed to wonder what happened&#8230; &#8220;it&#8217;s a bit of a mystery!&#8221; It&#8217;s really not; the prisoners escaped.</li>
<li>The team arrives at the prison, where the Space Police watch commander says that the escaped prisoners can&#8217;t leave the planet, since he removed key parts from all the Space Police vehicles. That being the case, the prisoners end up stealing Clutch&#8217;s ship. It seems as though the LEGO team is stranded, since all the other Space Police ships are disabled. Except&#8230; they&#8217;re not stranded, since the watch commander could literally just replace the parts (which we see him carrying) and all of the ships would work.</li>
<li>On the Castle planet of Ashlar, the Troll in charge of guarding the kingdom has built a giant wall to hide the castle so that Mallock (the wizard) can&#8217;t find it. I&#8217;m not sure why the Troll would need to do this, since Mallock has been locked up in space-jail for years, up until like an hour ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.62em;">Characters</span></p>
<p>Clutch&#8217;s big character trait is that he always works alone; a habit he adopted after the loss of his father (Rock Powers, natch) a few years earlier. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6AsY2hqgO0">He even has a song about it.</a></p>
<p>At the start of the film, Clutch is put in charge of a team for the first time; and yet, none of the other team members are surprised to be partnered <em>with him</em>, even though EVERYONE knows Clutch (and the fact that he works alone) since he is also THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON IN THE LEGO UNIVERSE FOR REASONS WE&#8217;RE NEVER TOLD. Clutch&#8217;s arc seems like it should be that he learns to work with his team, which is sort of what happens &#8212; though out of narrative convenience, rather than character interaction and development. At a certain point, it&#8217;s as if they all just randomly decided, &#8220;ok, let&#8217;s work together now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of the team, I should probably introduce them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brick Masterson is a Fireman, Weapons Specialist, and Demolitions Expert. He&#8217;s the muscle of the group, and kind of looks like <a href="http://nbcparksandrec.tumblr.com/image/73511503766">Ron Swanson.</a> Brick tends to destroy more things than he actually builds; the best weapon he makes is a glorified battering ram.</li>
<li>Peg Mooring is a Biologist and a woman (FYI, this film does not pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">the Bechdel test</a> in any way, shape, or form). She uses her biology know-how to recognize footprints and tame a dragon off-screen. She also has extra hair that she brings with her, because girl. There are no other named female characters in this film, although we do catch a glimpse of a few extras from the <a href="http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10193-1">Medieval Market Village</a> who say nothing and do nothing.</li>
<li>Bernie von Beam is an Engineer who does wacky things and wears a gear on his head for a significant portion of the film. He has an accent.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_1837" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bernie.png"><img class=" wp-image-1837 " alt="Jokes." src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bernie.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bernie.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bernie-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/bernie-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jokes.</p></div>
<p>The teams&#8217; terrestrial backup includes Kjeld Playwell (hah), head of the LEGO Organziation, and his in-house scientist Artie Fol (hah), who also does wacky things and is Clutch&#8217;s biggest fan (we know this because he tells us).</p>
<p>On Ashlar, there are some skeleton flunkies (one of whom is <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/">Chris Hardwick</a>), a good-guy Troll who loves Monty Python references, and Prince Varen, heir to the planetary throne. Mallock the Malign is the main villain of the film, even though some other evil guy named &#8220;Omega&#8221; gets name-dropped and then immediately forgotten.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design of the film is pretty bare-bones. Like many of the LEGO video games, the locations and vehicles that are not official LEGO sets are rendered as generically textured 3D backdrops; lots of grass, trees, rocks, cement, and solid colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_1833" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png"><img class=" wp-image-1833 " alt="CHECK OUT THOSE GRAPHICS" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">CHECK OUT THOSE GRAPHICS</p></div>
<p>There are a few things here and there that appear to have had actual thought put into them &#8212; Mallock&#8217;s stronghold comes to mind &#8212; but most of these are designed as a kind of weird kludge between brick-built and CG creations.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, the brick-built sets shown are actual LEGO products that were available in the time leading up to this film&#8217;s release. The same thing goes for the majority of the characters &#8212; the skeletons, the Troll, and Mallock (who was merely <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7093-1">an &#8216;evil wizard&#8217; in the 2007 Castle line</a>) all appeared in official LEGO kits, as did the Space Police officers and all of the extras.</p>
<p>Ironically, none of the main cast were ever created as minifigures. In fact, <strong>Clutch himself cannot even be built out of existing parts</strong>, as his torso and pants have custom printing, and <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=43753">his hairpiece has never been made in black</a>. Peg and Bernie&#8217;s wigs have never been made, either, and all of the faces are custom.</p>
<p>So, if you were a kid who watched this movie and wanted to build and play with the characters: not only could you not buy them in stores, you couldn&#8217;t even make them out of parts from your own collection. Even LEGO Universe <a href="http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Miscellaneous&amp;query=lego%20universe">wasn&#8217;t that bad</a>.</p>
<p>If there were such a thing as un-synergy, I think this would be it.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>The animation is fine; nothing to write home about. There&#8217;s some wonky mouth shapes and one or two floaty walks, but in general, the animation is effective and does the job it needs to do.</p>
<h3>Acting</h3>
<p>The voice acting in this film is decent, but it&#8217;s brought down by the poor writing and terribly stock dialogue. The biggest names involved are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McPartlin">Ryan McPartlin</a> (as Clutch) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Strahovski">Yvonne Strahovski</a> (as Peg), both of whom are from the TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)"><em>Chuck</em></a>. I&#8217;m not sure how they got involved with this film, since the target audience doesn&#8217;t exactly overlap. Maybe someone in casting was like &#8220;<em>Chuck</em> is about a secret agent. Clutch is kind of a secret agent. Let&#8217;s get some of those actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even stranger is the fact that, on <em>Chuck,</em> Ryan McPartlin&#8217;s character is not a secret agent or an explorer, or even a main character. He&#8217;s got a deep man voice with a nice sound to it, but it felt kind of wrong for the character of Clutch, who doesn&#8217;t really behave like a grown adult.</p>
<p>Again, part of that might be the writing. It&#8217;s obvious that the filmmakers wanted Clutch to be a cool Indiana Jones/James Bond type, but the way he&#8217;s written feels both immature and amateur. While watching the film, I wondered why they didn&#8217;t have the guy playing Prince Varen voice Clutch instead. Their story arcs are basically parallel, and even though the movie keeps TELLING us Clutch is famous and amazing, he feels just as young and inexperienced as the prince.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, <em>Clutch Powers</em> isn&#8217;t an offensive disaster, but it somehow manages to capture that rare combination of complexity and boredom. It unsuccessfully tries to be a movie by hitting those beats that other movies hit, and ultimately fails to be memorable, charming, or fun.</p>
<p>I did not laugh once.</p>
<p>Clutch himself is neither engaging nor lovable, and actually comes off as kind of a jerk for a significant portion of the movie. We never see or hear about any of his other missions, and most of what we do know about Clutch is merely what other characters tell us about him &#8212; even if that information contradicts the things we see him do on screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1836" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png"><img class=" wp-image-1836 " alt="&quot;I'm ambiguously mad at my father. It's his fault for going missing under suspicious circumstances!&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m ambiguously mad at my father. It&#8217;s his fault for going missing under suspicious circumstances!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The script is weak, and the majority of the dialogue has no subtext. When the characters aren&#8217;t spewing tired clichés (&#8220;Lock and load &#8212; we&#8217;re going in&#8221;), they&#8217;re either saying exactly how they feel or just giving mindless exposition. There are one or two attempts to tie in some LEGOish values (&#8220;We build on each other!&#8221;, &#8220;Time to get creative!&#8221;), but these are few and far between, and feel like an afterthought.</p>
<p>One of the strangest recurring subjects is the notion of a &#8220;creation spark&#8221;. This is apparently the equivalent of a minifigure soul, although nothing about it is ever explored or explained. In a practical sense, it seems to be a way for the writers to talk about characters being killed or dying without having to say &#8220;killed or dying&#8221;. But in a storytelling sense, I find it baffling &#8212; are these characters alive or not? Is the creation spark a physical thing? Are minifigures kind of like <a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Spark">Transformers</a>? We&#8217;re never told.</p>
<p>Other plot lines that lead nowhere include the fate of Clutch&#8217;s father, and the identities of the two other escaped prisoners. This film is very obviously trying to be the first part of a franchise, but in doing so, it fails to tell a coherent stand-alone story.</p>
<p>As with LEGO toys, I want the LEGO videos and movies that I watch to be of the highest quality; the kind of material I can return to and enjoy no matter how old I am. TLG&#8217;s target market of 5-to-12-year-olds may hold water in terms of toy sales, but there&#8217;s no denying the universal timelessness of LEGO products. A big deal is made of the fact that bricks and elements from the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, and so forth will all fit together with parts from modern sets. LEGO cinematic releases should follow the same long-range principle &#8212; films with something for everyone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the case with <em>Clutch Powers,</em> which is just a plodding, meaningless exercise where we see some sets that you could have bought in 2010, and then it&#8217;s over. I bring up the irony of &#8220;<a href="http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/lego-group/the_lego_history/1930">Only The Best Is Good Enough</a>&#8221; far too often when talking about LEGO home video releases, but TLG has set the bar really high for themselves with that motto, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned, has yet to reach it.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for The LEGO Movie.</p>
<h3>Where to watch this film</h3>
<p>If you really must see this film, it&#8217;s available to <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_The_Adventures_of_Clutch_Powers/70130180">stream on Netflix for free</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Clutch-Ryan-McPartlin/dp/B003363I3O/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390505461&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=clutch+powers">rent it on Amazon for $2.99</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Clutch-Ryan-McPartlin/dp/B0030ZIZRC/">buy the DVD for three bucks more</a>. But I really don&#8217;t recommend spending any money on this.</p>

<p>Can a live action short film be a &#8220;brickfilm&#8221; too?  <span id="more-1813"></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/andrewmfilms">AndrewMFilms</a> must think so. His new film called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fk5F5NMaCQ">LEGO Invasion!</a> mixes live action and CGI brickfiming together for a wild ride that is a mix between the LEGO Movie, Aliens, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Pulp Fiction.  Okay, maybe the last one is a stretch. The short film does showcase real plastic LEGO bricks which are used as the protagonist&#8217;s weapons.  All of the brick animating is CGI which is layered over the live action sequences quite seamlessly.  It is a really fun watch, unless you don&#8217;t seeing like your favorite super heroes getting blasted to bits by the protagonist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The eleventh <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/18221/thac-11-starts-now-closed/">Twenty four Hour Animation Contest</a> (or THAC11) is now behind us. This is the second year <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp-gjmrxnNc">I participated (Battle of Smallville)</a> and, while waiting for the results, I want to share with you some of the best entries.</p>
<p><span id="more-1773"></span></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s theme was &#8220;A Mistaken Identity.&#8221; You know, when you see someone and think they are someone else. In THAC, the theme can be interpreted however the participants like (and they did so in very creative ways).</p>
<p>If you like to play the game, you can try to spot the mod element. In every frame of the movie, there must be a red brick connected to a grey brick or the there must be the letter T visible in any way (printed, built, or anything creative that looks like a T). That is a way to make sure the participants produced their brickfilms within the 24 hour time frame of the contest.</p>
<p>It would take you over 2 hours to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr7QhekOKzovhLaYXqQboHU6QEAE_3cR">all 76 brickfilms</a> made for THAC11, but I picked out the best ones for you. Just for the fun of it, here’s my favorites in categories I just made up.</p>
<h2><b>Best overall performance</b><b></b></h2>
<h3><b>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQeWXkxMAY">The Does</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Cocotatam">A&amp;M Studios</a></b></h3>
<p>&#8220;The Does&#8221; takes us into a classic family sitcom with a nice setup and good animation. As the director says… well, you’ll see. I only want to point out that it is a very good use of different minifig&#8217;s heads.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RrQeWXkxMAY?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rpG7d6UBSo">Con</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Disney365Stitch">AquaMorph Productions</a></h3>
<p>Based on a good narration, the animation is well done and really helps to tell the story.<br />
Very good lightning&#8230; I love all those back lights.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0rpG7d6UBSo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDtS3dGAFqk">The Code’s Game</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AniMax4000?feature=watch">AniMax</a></h3>
<p>I don’t know the show they are referring to, but I catch the gist. What I like is the way there is a helicopter in the movie… without ever seeing it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JDtS3dGAFqk?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best Space Themed movie (aka MonsieurCaron’s favorite)</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TXSU-C-uC4">Sector Se7en</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Olsonstudios?feature=watch">Spencer Olson Films</a></h3>
<p>Wow, the best short in my opinon. And it’s in Space, what can I ask more? The use of SFX for the holograph and the flying is very well done.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3TXSU-C-uC4?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Q-SJLi5_Q">The Supervisor</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander?feature=watch">Legoander</a></h3>
<p>WOW. This is a simple yet effective little story. And well animated robots and humans.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/88Q-SJLi5_Q?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epzj1mWgJPg">Planet of the Sneeuwpop</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Annoying Noises Productions</a></h3>
<p>You gotta love the way those spacemen teleport.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/epzj1mWgJPg?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best use of microscale</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6NhmsuDNBs">Expectation</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lgfb1film?feature=watch">Loïc F-B</a></h3>
<p>Loïc F-B made good use of lightning in his film. I love his city landscape in forced perspective. I’m taking notes here for my own movies.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/v6NhmsuDNBs?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0SssMPCLlI">The Key</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BindingBrick?feature=watch">Binding Brick</a></h3>
<p>Making the spaceship in microscale was a great idea. A nice montage that goes well with the music.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K0SssMPCLlI?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Most amazing integration of the mod element</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEA_4A8UOik">Mental</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCWynns?feature=watch">Chris Wynn</a></h3>
<p>The way the MOD element (the letter T) is hidden is just awesome. Check the white walls.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DEA_4A8UOik?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best use of Chima</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80nZanGzxjo">AX 2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PritchardStudios?feature=watch">PritchardStudios</a></h3>
<p>Good use of Chima minifig and Chi bricks. I like the way we switch between worlds.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/80nZanGzxjo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best dream sequence</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1z7E3JNqE">No Crawme Steals Christmas</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SpiderSock?feature=watch">Brickhead Productions</a></h3>
<p>You must see that cop sleeveless ! And… is that a song or what ? It’s a great movie!</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dW1z7E3JNqE?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5x0Gm8IqSM">How I survived</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/filmyguy1?feature=watch">Sean Willets</a></h3>
<p>I could have put this one into the &#8220;Best use of microscale&#8221; too.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/C5x0Gm8IqSM?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best plot twist</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3hQKqd8dSU">The Liberator</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bluper8?feature=watch">Bluper8</a></h3>
<p>There’s a good twist in this story.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/l3hQKqd8dSU?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA1rD2GjiYo">The Police Delivery</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ForlornCreature?feature=watch">ForlornCreature</a></h3>
<p>Another well animated good short story.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jA1rD2GjiYo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKsUlIlsd4g">Magnus Lapsus</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MightyWanderer1?feature=watch">Mighty Wanderer</a></h3>
<p>Nice smooth animation and good voice acting… except for the end. NOOoooo</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PKsUlIlsd4g?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best non-English language</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbXyogAQMnc">Fish tale</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/soppenjim?feature=watch">soppenjim</a></h3>
<p>Very funny use of the theme. The spoken language is Norwegian. Don’t worry, there’s subtitles.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cbXyogAQMnc?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>You can wath <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr7QhekOKzovhLaYXqQboHU6QEAE_3cR">all 76 brickfilms</a> on this playlist.</p>
<p>As you know, the <i>C</i> in THAC is for Contest, but I prefer to look a this event as a Challenge. If you can make a good brickfilm within 24 hours, you&#8217;re a winner, you made the challenge. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Tell us which one is your favorite brickfilm in this year&#8217;s THAC and why… because there are so many ways a brickfilm can be great!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an annoying spot plaguing a man&#8217;s window, and it won&#8217;t go away. This new brickfilm from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander?feature=watch" target="_blank">Legoander</a> is nothing less than intriguing.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Osf5PUND1_I?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
<span id="more-1761"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those videos that, by the time it was over, had me sitting and thinking. The animation, simple white set, and that truly bizarre red dot carried me through this three-minute short, but it didn&#8217;t stop there. Some of my favorite movies and animations are the ones that don&#8217;t have a conclusion. Sure, the video definitely had an ending, but it didn&#8217;t conclude. It doesn&#8217;t spoon feed the answer but begs for questions to be asked and things to be thought over.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think it means?</strong></em></p>

<p>I was intrigued to find this pamphlet tucked away inside the November-December 2013 issue of the LEGO Club Magazine. Billed as the &#8220;Special LEGO Video Guide&#8221;, it purports to feature the &#8220;top 2013 LEGO videos, free online games, apps, and more!&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, it&#8217;s just one big advertisement for LEGO multimedia content (much like what the Club Magazine itself is for LEGO toys). But it definitely points towards increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content, most likely in preparation for <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">the release of The LEGO Movie next February.</a><span id="more-1698"></span></p>
<p>And since &#8220;increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content&#8221; is our middle name here, I figured I&#8217;d take a second to walk you guys through this &#8220;Entertainment Guide&#8221; brochure&#8230;</p>
<h2>The Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cover is made up to look like an &#8220;Entertainment Weekly&#8221; magazine, both in terms of layout and font choice for the title. In fact, I&#8217;m kind of surprised they were able to get away with that. Parody&#8230; I guess?</li>
<li>Chase McCain is holding a LEGO Clapboard tile, which says &#8220;Awards!&#8221; on it. I&#8217;m not sure what that&#8217;s referring to, since there are no awards given or listed on the pages within. It almost feels like a movie industry word association game. &#8220;What are some other Hollywood-related words&#8230; how about &#8216;Awards&#8217;?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 1-2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first spread is titled &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos!&#8221;, though based on the content being presented, that&#8217;s a pretty arbitrary label. All the videos in this pamphlet are official LEGO releases, which means they&#8217;re somewhat limited in scope. How or why these particular videos were chosen to be the &#8220;top&#8221; videos, it doesn&#8217;t say, but there was basically nothing noteworthy I hadn&#8217;t seen before.</li>
<li>Seeing the Paganomation-produced LEGO <a href="http://youtu.be/PXPA0fEU1aA">Superman</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Rv4Mmkokexc">Iron Man</a> videos listed in there was a nice touch, though.</li>
<li>The only new content to catch my eye was not a video at all, but a notice for a &#8220;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">NEW FREE LEGO TV APP</a>&#8221; available on iTunes. This was the first I had ever heard of such an app existing; though, thanks to similar notices on subsequent pages, it was not the last.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 3-4</h2>
<ul>
<li>More of the &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos&#8221;, including the &#8220;first trailer&#8221; for The LEGO Movie. <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">Didn&#8217;t the second trailer already come out?</a></li>
<li>I can appreciate how repetitive it must be to write short blurbs about so many conceptually similar LEGO videos, but some of the grammar/sentence structure in this brochure is kinda wonky. &#8220;How did it go from idea to finished LEGO Specials?&#8221; How indeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 5-6</h2>
<ul>
<li>These pages focus on LEGO City video/game media from 2013. Page 6 is solely devoted to advertising a new LEGO City game for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Page 5 does focus on videos; though oddly, they&#8217;re all CGI entries. What&#8217;s weirder are the &#8220;milestone&#8221;-type captions on a few of the thumbnail images: &#8220;First Appearance of Dalmatian Firedog&#8221;! Oh&#8230; okay. &#8220;Most Minifigures in a Single Video!&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s not really true; it&#8217;s CG, so technically there are no minifigures in that video.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 7-8</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pages 7 and 8 feature an ad for the Cartoon Network &#8220;Legends of Chima&#8221; CG series, which I have yet to check out in any capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 9-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>The spread on pages 9 and 10 is entitled, &#8220;Mini Movies&#8230; Big Creativity!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rather than focusing on specific video entries, these blurbs talk more generally about a few LEGO video genres &#8212; Microsquare (a series of Master Builder how-to videos), LEGO CGI Animation (technically a medium, not a genre), and Seasonal Shorts (Adventures of Max, the Brick-a-Brack Bunch, etc.).</li>
<li>More strange sentences: &#8220;Featuring the Brick-a-Brack Bunch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  on zany adventures, look for these videos during holidays and when the seasons change.&#8221; &#8220;A Club Member favorite, &#8216;Adventures of Max,&#8217; from the LEGO Club TV Show have been an online mainstay for a few years, following the LEGO Club mascot on adventures that take him under the sea, into outer space, and follow him through almost every LEGO line.&#8221;</li>
<li>And another ad touting &#8220;2 ways to watch: catch them all at <a href="http://www.lego.com/clubvideos">LEGO.com/clubvideos</a> OR Ask your parents to download the FREE LEGO TV APP on your iPhone or tablet.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yet another ad for Legends of Chima.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest takeaway from this brochure is the existence of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">the LEGO TV mobile app</a>, which I think is pretty cool. Anything that gets LEGO videos further out into the public eye can only be a good thing, I think.</li>
<li>However, there are some inconsistencies. For example, our aforementioned LEGO Iron Man short is nowhere to be found on the LEGO TV app, despite the claim that all videos shown in the guide are available to watch on the app. I wonder how many other videos might have been lost in the void.</li>
<li>The other interesting thing I discovered via this brochure is the existence of yet another outlet for LEGO Video content. When the blurb mentioned checking out club videos on the LEGO website, I assumed it was talking about <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO Club Videos page.</a> In fact, it&#8217;s talking about something else entirely: <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">a Videos page on LEGO.com itself.</a></li>
<li>This newer videos page does seem to be more thorough than the Club Videos page ever was; though, on this new page, there is again <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos/themes/club">a subcategory for Club Videos</a>, effectively rendering the separate Club Videos page outmoded and redundant.</li>
<li>I am again baffled by the ways in which The LEGO Group continues <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/official-lego-youtube-channel/">the fracturing of their video releases</a>; especially when it&#8217;s clear from this brochure that they want more people to check out said videos. Now we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lego">the official LEGO YouTube channel</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/legoclubtv">the old (dead) LEGO Club TV channel</a>, <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the Club Videos page</a>, <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO.com Videos page</a>, the LEGO Movie Maker App &#8220;Movie Gallery&#8221; section, the LEGO TV app, ReBrick.com&#8230; sheesh.</li>
<li>Why not just have ONE central location and drive all the traffic there? I get wanting to have as many people as possible see the video content itself, but this just feels like a big mess. I want to be able to come back to the same place every time and see all the video content there is; not have to figure out which videos were uploaded where, when, and then try to keep tabs on all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, what did you guys think of the The 2013 LEGO Club Entertainment Guide? Are you going to check out the LEGO TV app?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know how trailers for movies often spoil the best parts? That&#8217;s how I feel about &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW0QOm6l2E">BULB</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/animationIsaac">animationIssac</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nKW0QOm6l2E?rel=0&amp;start=288&amp;end=348" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><span id="more-1702"></span></p>
<p>I saw <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZFBdPJafZs">the trailer for BULB</a> this summer and was intrigued. I can&#8217;t think of any other brickfilm that legitimately qualifies as a horror movie (but feel free to disabuse me of this notion in the comments). Most of the times that monsters show up in brickfilms, it ends up being a comedy or an action film (<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/11/lovecraftian-pastiche/">or a little bit of both</a>).</p>
<p>Today, I finally got around to watching all twelve minutes of BULB and was disappointed. I&#8217;ve embedded the one minute of the animation I feel is noteworthy, but if you&#8217;ve watched the trailer you&#8217;ve already seen it. This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKW0QOm6l2E&amp;t=4m48s">scene</a> is creepy and mysterious and features some nice cinematography, sound design, and editing. I particularly like the rapid pacing of the normal life shots immediately following the dream.</p>
<p>The other eleven minutes of BULB are boring and repetitive and don&#8217;t really explain or justify the  awesome minute in the middle. The intertitles and one-dimensional love interest are more intrusive than useful. If this had stayed focus on the bizarre occurrences in the Underground and how they affected the protagonist, it might have been an interesting film. If you feel compelled to watch the rest, I recommend opting into the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/html5">YouTube HTML5 test</a> so you can watch it at double speed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three brickfilms recent caught my attention for their overlapping themes of alien invasions and minifigs being built by assembly line robots.</p>
<p><span id="more-1684"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/aC0QlycezEk" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC0QlycezEk">The Day Aliens Finally Invaded</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MRlegobuilder987">Pushover Productions</a> only came in 10th place in <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/17572/brawl-2013-results/">BRAWL 2013</a>. Sure, there&#8217;s no fancy cinematography and the sets and animation are pretty simple, but it&#8217;s absolutely hilarious! All the characters, from the bumbling aliens, to the inane citizens, to the sadistic general are exactly the right level of wacky. Of course, it&#8217;s pretty clear that the director and I share a sense of humor, considering I awarded his previous video &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N30D4yIeUMs">Block Ball</a>&#8221; first place in one of my animation contests. I guess there are other legitimate criteria for judging a brickfilm than how much it makes me laugh. But as far as I&#8217;m concerned, this animation wins.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XMWg8t6teHk" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMWg8t6teHk">Indus</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheJedidu78">Aiwha Bruno Lefevre</a> opens with a impressive 30 second moving shot that shows off a factory where robots assemble minifigures. That shot alone makes this animation worth watching. Bruno manages to give a pretty basic robot some personality through a well done head tilt, but the animation is over before the story goes anywhere.  A robot falls in love with a human woman and shows affection the only way it can. That&#8217;s a interesting setup for a story, but it it would have been nice to see the conflict explored more. Does the woman reciprocate the feelings? Does the robot get deactivated and replaced by one without emotions? Does the army of clone women take over the galaxy?</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/tHFcZAh1Kg4" height="480" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHFcZAh1Kg4">Neighborly Part 1</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TopSecretSpyGuy">TopSecretSpyGuy</a> combines the alien invasion and minifig assembly robots in an auspicious debut film. This really deserves 10 times the views it has. The set and lighting of the alien spaceship are detailed and atmospheric. The squabbling of the aliens is amusing (though not as laugh-out-loud funny as the alien banter from &#8220;The Day Aliens Finally Invaded&#8221;) and the ending leaves me excited to future episodes. But the real highlights are the aforementioned minifig assembly machines, which are delightfully greebly and smoothly animated.</p>
<p>Has anyone else encountered serendipitous venn diagrams of brickfilms?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t feature this brick recreation of a small part of the &#8220;Thriller&#8221; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&amp;t=1m53s">music video</a>.</p>

<p>You may remember when we featured Annette&#8217;s <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/03/michael-jacksons-moves/">last Michael Jackson brick animation</a> back in March. &#8220;<a href="https://vimeo.com/73564884#">LEGO Thriller</a>&#8221; is a step-up in terms of complexity and technique. Not only is it at a larger scale and resolution than her previous work, but her use of layering at key moments adds depth to the otherwise flat animation. It&#8217;s a powerful effect. I&#8217;m also quite fond of her use of upside down bricks to add a different texture to the girl&#8217;s shirt.<br />
Keep &#8217;em coming Annette!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdGrYlDaxYw">Major Malfunction</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MisterMulluc">MisterMulluc</a>, you are missing out on a fantastic five minute miracle of animation.</p>

<p>Okay, now that you&#8217;ve watched that, let&#8217;s talk about what makes it superlatively awesome. Amazing animation, creative character design, non-stop comedy, and great camera work, it&#8217;s got everything.. My only tiny criticism would be that there&#8217;s no real story (i.e. I don&#8217;t know why a robot is chasing two well-dressed chaps through a jungle), but then again it&#8217;s got about as much story as &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221; and most &#8220;Looney Tunes&#8221; cartoons. Also, that tiny complaint is buried under a mountain of adoration. I love the way the palm tree gets &#8220;bent&#8221; at 1:09, the way the guy with the hat keeps putting his hat back on, the absurdist touches like a sign with legs, the cartoonish back and forth starting at 3:20, and<strong> did I mention the piano-playing robot!?! </strong>Every action is well-motivated and fluidly animated. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this.<strong></strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Story</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1546" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-300x196.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" width="300" height="196" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-300x196.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-700x458.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM.png 703w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In &#8220;CL!CK&#8221;, our wacky inventor (let&#8217;s call him Dr. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDH3AoOQzE0">Zach</a>arias <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego#1890s.E2.80.931950s">Playwell</a>) is trying to invent a way for humans to fly, he gets inspired after a visit to the Idea Factory. In &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; Dr. Playwell steals LEGO bricks from children so he can build a toy rock band and dance.</p>
<p>Both videos serve as charming parables about the creative process. &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; focuses on the frustration that comes from butting your head up against a problem repeatedly without knowing how to solve it, and the ensuing euphoria when you finally arrive at a solution. In short, it is a story about overcoming writer&#8217;s/inventor&#8217;s/creator&#8217;s block. The concept of the Idea Factory as the place to go to be inspired is a little half-baked (especially when you remember it is also a metaphor for the LEGO CL!CK website), but it serves its purpose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1547" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-300x165.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-31 at 11.02.49 PM" width="300" height="165" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-300x165.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-700x386.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM.png 843w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; is a story about writer&#8217;s block, then &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; is a story about how borrowing/stealing/remixing other people&#8217;s ideas is an essential part of the creative process. There&#8217;s less of a story arc here; Dr. Playwell doesn&#8217;t have what he needs, but then he gets it with little resistance. The stakes may be low, but the message is clear: LEGO is reaffirming it&#8217;s core principles as a toy of endless possibilities. It also works as a &#8220;so that&#8217;s where all the missing socks go&#8221; tale.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1549" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.43.52-PM.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" /></p>
<p>There is no dialogue in either film aside from Dr. Playwell&#8217;s frustrated grunts and jubilant &#8220;AHA!&#8221;s, so the storytelling is almost entirely visual. Question mark boxes float above Dr. Playwell&#8217;s head when he&#8217;s stumped, his ideas come to life on paper and in bricks, and his face says all we need to know.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1551" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.01.32-PM.png" alt="The Brick Thief" width="305" height="168" />The set design of the laboratory evokes the stop-motion films of Jan Švankmejer. In particular, Dr. Playwell&#8217;s wall of tiny doors recalls Svankmejer&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/alice,26377/">Alice</a>&#8220;. The controlled playfulness of the Ideas Factory brings to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFeLKXbnxxg">Google campus</a> or <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2012/01/31/lego-pmd-by-rosan-bosch-and-rune-fjord/">the building where LEGO set designers work</a>. Creativity is portrayed simultaneously as messy and personal and as clean and corporate.</p>
<p>The dim, flickery lighting and vignetting makes the films feel like early silent films. This is an appropriate stylistic choice given the lack of dialogue. Makes me wish some one would do a Méliès homage brickfilm.</p>
<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>The first time I watched &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; I was blown away by the animation. I couldn&#8217;t believe that they had managed to do such intricate stop-motion of the LEGO models while also stop-animating the human actor. I was right not to believe.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1554" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" width="725" height="463" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM.png 725w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM-300x191.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM-700x447.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s not immediately obvious to the untrained eye (or, at least, wasn&#8217;t to mine), the animated LEGO bricks in these two films are photo-realistic CGI rather than physical LEGO bricks. The telltale sign is the unnatural sheen of the bricks; they are just a tad too luminous to be real. The CGI was done by <a href="https://vimeo.com/a52">a52</a>, which specializes in photo-real visual effects.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1556" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.23-PM.png" alt="The Brick Thief" width="302" height="158" />I wanted to highlight these films in light of the recent revelations that &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/tag/thelegomovie/">The LEGO Movie</a>&#8221; will employ a similar style of photo-realistic stop-motionesque CGI (though on a much grander scale). It is an interesting compromise that retains the stop-motion aesthetic while significantly reducing the cost/complexity. It is certainly preferable to the animation style of the Ninjago TV series which gives characters un-LEGO-like flexibility.</p>
<p>All that being said, the animation in &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; is inventive and well-executed. Highlights include a rocket turning into shoe then into an exclamation point, a windmill that lets off musical notes, and the puffs of smoke coming out of the Idea factory.</p>
<p>Marius Begai also deserves mention here as the actor behind Dr. Playwell. His animated expressions are delightful and his stop-motion dance moves are enviable. Stop-motion acting is a unique skill, much like being a puppeteer and a puppet at the same time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>&#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; are different than the average LEGO commercial. They have a unique visual style and rather than selling the latest LEGO set, they have timeless messages about creativity. In this way, they are reminiscent of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBmYkiRwKQ">vintage</a> LEGO commercials.  I would love to see more LEGO commercials in this vein. &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIZ2lua9aQA">Build Together</a>&#8221; is the only comparable one I can think of from recent years.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s also important to evaluate these videos in the context of <a href="http://showcase.noagencyname.com/Lego/Click/">LEGO CL!CK writ large</a>. The LEGO CL!CK <a href="http://www.legoclick.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legoclick?ref=ts">social</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/legoclick/">media</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/legoclick?feature=watch">channels</a> are now dormant, only a few years after they launched. They have become more cruft floating in the LEGO digital ocean. My guess is that they were either abandoned so LEGO could focus efforts on <a href="http://rebrick.lego.com">ReBrick,</a> or because they were being run by an ad agency and never intended to be long-term. There&#8217;s a parallel here to the many YouTubers who used to brickfilm and have either disappeared or turned into video game focused channels.</p>
<p>Even when it was actively updated, the CL!CK website was hard to use. Its Flash-based design means it won&#8217;t load on mobile devices. Pieces of content appear as giant teetering stack of LEGO bricks. It looks cool, but it is confusing to navigate. If you know how to find them, there are a few awesome micro-blogs by my illustrious co-editor, but it&#8217;s impossible for me to link directly to them. Given the emphasis placed these days on mobile-friendliness and content sharability, the LEGO CL!CK website serves as a stark reminder of how much web design standards have changed over the last few years.</p>
<p>In this sense, the LEGO CL!CK website becomes a parable for another part of the creative process: the idea that didn&#8217;t work. Despite winning a <a href="http://pereiraodell.com/news/silver-and-bronze-pencils-for-lego-clck">bunch</a> of advertising <a href="http://www.mjz.com/directors/blue-source/awards/">awards</a>, LEGO CL!CK has clearly not been a long-term success for LEGO. One of the things the LEGO Group does well is try out a wide variety of ideas and then focus their resources behind the ones that are successful. This means they have a lot of themes and products that are swiftly abandoned after only a year or two. LEGO CL!CK is another crumpled piece of paper in the great LEGO trash bin next to Galidor, LEGO Universe, and Clikits.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As writers of <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com">the Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild</a> Brickfilming News and Events Blog, we are constantly searching the internet for brickfilming news. We discovered that a few types of brickfilms get more online news coverage than others. <span id="more-1481"></span> There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much online news coverage about the average typical brickfilm.  There&#8217;s also not much coverage about fan made superhero or Star Wars brickfilms. Online news coverage, along with the views, generally goes to brickfilms that are: 1) recreations of movie trailers, 2) video game inspired, 3) sports re-enactments, 4) music videos of songs from popular artists, 5) marriage proposals, and 6) all the PR stuff about LEGO sponsored/produced CGI animations like Batman, Star Wars, and the upcoming LEGO Movie.</p>
<p>To narrow things down, let&#8217;s just look at the genre of brickfilm movie trailers. Movie trailers done as brickfilms are typically animated frame for frame to the existing original trailer&#8217;s soundtrack. I found nine movie trailers recreated in LEGO to examine and showcase.</p>
<p>1) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=c57lVldtENw">The Heat</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/grey4484">Garrett Barati</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c57lVldtENw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of Garrett Barati and I love this brickfilm movie trailer. The animation is very realistic and true to the original trailer. All of the props and scenery in the backgrounds give such depth to each scene. I especially like the floor patten in the police jail scene, simple with a nice addition. The real movie Heat had decent success at the box office, but the recreated version doesn&#8217;t have many views. It surely deserves more than it has right now. Perhaps the R rating hurts the potential audience that appreciates brickfilms.</p>
<p>2) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsCigaRp-o">Wolverine</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ugsCigaRp-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Antonio Toscano has his niche in brickfilming. It&#8217;s making brickfilm movie trailers. He has found success in his brickfilm movie trailers as he has over a million views between his four trailers. &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; is Toscano&#8217;s most recent brickfilm movie trailer and is the first of four on this list of nine brickfilm trailers.  It currently has just over 10,000 views on YouTube. The sets and the lighting are all good and the energy of the animation totally works for the brickfilm trailer. The animation is a bit little choppy at times, but doesn&#8217;t distract or take away from this great brickfilm.</p>
<p>3) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7JGT0yxxMw">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7JGT0yxxMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This one is my favorite of Antonio Toscano&#8217;s brickfilm movie trailers. Maybe I just have a fondness for Star Trek. The micro-scale that was used in some of the scenes worked well. The trailer had a great selection of the minifigures. An <a href="http://www.itworld.com/internet/348999/mash-gold-star-trek-trailer-meets-lego">article about Toscano&#8217;s trailer</a> was written by ITWORLD.</p>
<p>4) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFLoAa00NFs">Lego Man of Steel Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bFLoAa00NFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video has over a quarter million plus views on YouTube. It stays very true to the original trailer. There are a few issues with the animation here and there, but like some of the other Toscano&#8217;s brickfilms, it doesn&#8217;t hurt the energy of the recreation. <a href="http://entertainment.msn.co.nz/blog.aspx?blogentryid=1082918&amp;showcomments=true">EntertainmentFIX</a> and <a href="http://www.unleashthefanboy.com/news/man-of-steel-trailer-in-lego-glory/41076">Unleash the Fan Boy</a> wrote blogs about this video.</p>
<p>5) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO4fP1DwBeo">Iron Man 3 Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mO4fP1DwBeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This brickfilm recreation is closing in on one million views. It&#8217;s loaded with extensive chroma keying that&#8217;s well achieved. The scene with the helicopters attacking Tony Stark&#8217;s home was the scene that worked best for me. Toscano had fun with this one. There are a few easter eggs that are hidden in the film. I also like Toscano&#8217;s style of making explosions with special effects. The explosions have a realness to them as they are not just keyed in explosions from <a href="http://www.detonationfilms.com/">Detonation Films</a>, the explosions use real bricks in the effects.</p>
<p>6) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF7S3bSltTs">The Dark Knight Rises TRAILER#1 in LEGO!</a>&#8220;by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EF7S3bSltTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first of the movie trailer recreations that have earned over one million views. It&#8217;s brilliantly done with great animation, lighting, special effects, and incredible CGI scenes. My complaint with this trailer has everything to with the original trailer, not Forrest Whaley&#8217;s recreation. There&#8217;s not enough Batman, I think he&#8217;s in only one scene. I want to see BATMAN! You can always count on Forrest for top notch brickfilms.</p>
<p>7) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5Zf7aol3oM">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 TRAILER</a>&#8221; in LEGO by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O5Zf7aol3oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a first class professional grade recreation and my favorite of the two Forrestfire101 trailers on this list. It has great special effects, great lighting effects, and is also incredibly well animated. Forrest did not rely on CGI like his Dark Knight Rises Trailer. Forrest might be the king of college age humor using LEGO animation, but he can also make top notch movie trailers in LEGO. Kudos Forrest! It&#8217;s also great to be able to share a few of his brickfilms with our young daughter.</p>
<p>8) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEwUwslyaEQ">Dark Knight Rises Trailer 3: IN LEGO</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ParanickFilmz?feature=watch">ParanickFilmz</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dEwUwslyaEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a very well done recreation, and must have taken ages to make. Some of the scenes rely on CGI and have a less of an authentic feel compared to the stop motion scenes. The mouth movements and facial animation are also well done. The lighting and special effects were superb. <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/watch-the-third-dark-knight-rises-trailer-recreated-with-lego/">Comic Book Creation</a> posted an article about this trailer.</p>
<p>9) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6PPvUhR4c&amp;list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&amp;index=9">Cars 2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PatrickBoivin?feature=watch">Patrick Boivin</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&#038;index=8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Patrick Boivin is a professional stop motion artist and it shows. Although he doesn&#8217;t work with LEGO for most of his animations, the Cars 2 Trailer that he created is one of the most impressive brickfilms that I have ever seen. This jaw dropping trailer was released back in 2011 and now has over ten million views. It was a paid commission work from LEGO, Disney, and Pixar. Mr. Boivin was not completely alone on this project. He had the benefit of getting help from a &#8220;builders team at LEGO&#8221; on the scenic elements. I wish I had a team like that for my brickfilms. The &#8220;facial&#8221; animations are top notch and don&#8217;t seem like some painted on effect done in post production. Folks, it doesn&#8217;t get any better than this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmb0qVSd2rY">Henri &amp; Edmond – Droits d’auteur</a>&#8221; (&#8220;Copyright&#8221; in English) is the second brickfilm by Maxime Marion (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/studiosepsilon/">StudioEpsilon</a>) featuring Henri, the hero, and Edmond, his firefighter friend who always helps him out of trouble&#8230; with style.  &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs62M5EQNqA">Henri &amp; Edmond – Le Nouveau Voisin</a>&#8221; (The New Neighbour) was the first brickfilm and was 7 minutes long. The second chapter is an amazing 32 minutes of pure fun.<span id="more-1438"></span><br />

<h3>Plot</h3>
<p>Henri is pursued by SACOM ( a fictional music protection agency possibly based on <a href="http://www.sacem.fr/cms/site/en/home?pop=1">SACEM</a>) for illegally downloading the song &#8220;<a href="http://benjaminbriggs.bandcamp.com/track/brick-lady-performed-by-the-dragonflies">Brick Lady</a>,&#8221; from the Internet. He calls his friend Edmond for help and together they try to escape SACOM and its obsessed boss Vince Stub. And they do it with &#8220;style&#8221; (according to Edmond, &#8220;style&#8221; can’t be described, sorry.)</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1442 alignleft" title="Henri &amp; Edmond in Copyright " alt="Henri and Edmond get away on a small fire truck" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright-300x126.png" width="300" height="126" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright-300x126.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright-700x294.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>I must first point out the excellent script. Everything helps the story, there is nothing to cut. What happens in the beginning is referred to later (even if it’s only for a joke). Everything has a meaning. When the story concludes, you’ll know what I mean.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MediumAwareness">metafictional humor</a> too. Henri and Edmond are plastic minifigures, and they know it. Yes. When Edmond want to cheer up his friend, he tell him this story (no spoilers here).</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was a kid, I wanted to be an acrobat. But someday, I realized that I was only a plastic figure, and that I don’t have neither elbow nor knee joint. But one day, my uncle came to me and told me that I must never give up though I’m only a figure… Where there’s a will, there’s a way and I could be much more than <b>a piece of plastic. </b></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1446 alignright" alt="Vince Stub looking at hi-tch screen tracking Henri &amp; Edmond" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright2-300x128.png" width="300" height="128" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright2-300x128.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright2-700x298.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_copyright2.png 853w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Not only do they know they are made of plastic, but they also know that they are in a movie. &#8220;We’re in the middle of a dynamic montage.&#8221;  says Edmond to Henri right in the middle of… a montage! And sometime they refer to the script writer or the film’s direction.  If you like these kind of jokes, see their first adventure, &#8220;The New Neighbor,&#8221; for even more.</p>
<h3>Technique and Animation</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_stylish.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1447" alt="Henri and Edmond sit silhouetted in front of a sunset " src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_stylish.png" /></a></p>
<p>Maxime Morin’s work on lightning is amazing, it changes a lot, going from day light to sunset to night. The camera angles too must be mentioned, they are various and creative for a brickfilm, and gives you the feeling your watching a Hollywood movie. And speaking of camera angles, there’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmb0qVSd2rY&amp;t=12m23s">a scene</a> where Henri is hiding himself behind other minifigs by moving exactly as they do (Edmond calls that &#8220;the axis trick&#8221;). Look carefully and you’ll see that he’s there. That scene is not only funny, it’s a chef d’œuvre (masterpiece) of brickfilm animation.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_axis_trick.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1449 alignleft" title="Henri &amp; Edmond - Copyright" alt="Two minfigures do the same actions while standing behind one another" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_axis_trick-300x126.png" width="300" height="126" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_axis_trick-300x126.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_axis_trick-700x294.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/henri_edmond_axis_trick.png 857w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>&#8220;Copyright&#8221; is Maxime Morin’s personal project. It took him around 9 to 10 months of work in a three years period. He did all the animation and asked his friends to help with voices and post-production. As Maxime Morin works in the video business, it was easy for him to find friends who were passionate about his project, pro or not. I must mention that the French voices are very professional, as is the sound design… and everything else.</p>
<p>Oh! Did I mention that Henri &amp; Edmond is in French? Don’t worry, there’s English subtitles.</p>
<p>But the song is in English. &#8220;Brick Lady&#8221; performed by &#8220;The Dragonflies&#8221; is not only the music of this brickfilm, it’s also part of the story.  In fact,<a href="http://benjaminbriggs.bandcamp.com/album/copyright-original-soundtrack"> the movie&#8217;s official Original Soundtrack</a> is available on Bandcamp.</p>
<p>There is more to say, but I will stop here. On the other hand, Henri &amp; Edmond won’t stop here because there is a third movie coming out soon. The title is &#8220;Plastic Love.&#8221; See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Henri-Edmond/146823244789">their Facebook page</a> for the poster.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month we had the privilege of running the <a title="Enter the Second Annual Brickworld Film Festival!" href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/02/enter-the-second-annual-brickworld-film-festival/">2nd Annual Brickworld Film Festival</a>. We had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRC7toJD_QWVtPpP28RDzB3_">eight great entries</a> spanning a variety of genres and styles, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE7Hwma3pE">a live-action comedy sketch</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkwqEQ6fjU">a pulp-style space adventure</a>. Over 160 people showed up to watch and vote on the films.<span id="more-1228"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230" alt="audience watching a projection screen" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg" width="700" height="333" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re grateful to all the Lego filmmakers who dedicated hours to making these films. We know how much work and courage it takes to make a film and show it to a crowd of strangers. Without them, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a festival.</p>
<p>This year we gave out two trophies. The &#8220;Most Popular Film&#8221; trophy went to Paul Vermeesch (and friends) for &#8220;Nottingham Tower.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fDIV9p6CArY" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDIV9p6CArY">Nottingham Tower</a>&#8221; was easily the most technically impressive and ambitious film in the festival. It features smooth animation, fast-paced fight choreography, and impressive camera movements. We were quite pleased to see it win the popular vote; it was richly deserved.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1233" alt="Five guys standing on a stage smiling" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-1024x768.jpg" width="700" height="525" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-268x200.jpg 268w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-700x525.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>The second trophy went to the film that David and I agreed on as being the most well-rounded. We looked for a film that balanced story-telling, creativity, humor, and technical skill while also fitting into the Brickworld 2013 theme of Heroes and Villains. The winner of &#8220;Best Film&#8221; was &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1ncWyr-4AU">From Baking to Bad Guys</a>&#8221; by Caleb Schilling.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/R1ncWyr-4AU" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>We felt that of all the films submitted, this one did the best job of giving the audience an understanding of the protagonist&#8217;s motivations. The protagonist has a clear goal (become a real fire fighter), faces challenges along the way (he is better at cooking than fighting fires), but ultimately triumphs. The film also did an excellent job of setting a mood through the lighting and music, and it featured interesting animation throughout (the opening city shot and the cake baking sequence are my favorites).</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1236" alt="Three guys standing on a stage smiling" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k-1024x809.jpg" width="700" height="553" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k-1024x809.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k-300x237.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k-700x553.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077081061_88ca0a64ed_k.jpg 1402w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>After we finished the main festival screening, we showed some of our favorite brick animations that we&#8217;ve highlighted on this blog in the past year. You can see the playlist we screened <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRAbAqilEBtDtvcefiPO7FXk">here</a>. Thanks to every one who came out for the festival! We hope to see even more people there next year.</p>
<p>P.S. On Thursday of Brickworld we taught a 3-hour workshop on LEGO Animation. We took that opportunity to publicly unveil the Set Bump Logo for the first time. Here&#8217;s a photo of that which is 100% candid and not at all staged:</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a virus in your computer! But don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s adorable, and very-well animated. How has a great brick animation like &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxBvWPcPQiw">VIRUS</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fremanga?feature=watch">Fred Mangan</a> gone virtually unnoticed on YouTube for two years? You&#8217;d think that it would be a little more&#8230; viral (sorry, I couldn&#8217;t resist).</p>
<p>Seriously though, this is a high-caliber brick animation that you need to watch. The large-scale characters are expressive in their movements and the sets have just enough detail to be interesting. The sound design is perfectly matched to the action and the story is unusual enough to be interesting. Makes you wonder what else is waiting out there undiscovered in the depths of YouTube&#8230;</p>

<p>For a first attempt at brick animation, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRS5glRSkWs">LEGO: The Time Machine</a>&#8221; by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FlyingMinifig?feature=watch">FlyingMinifig</a> shows a considerable amount of promise. While the animation is shaky (set bumps ahoy!) and the light flickers throughout, there is some interesting camerawork, good use of replacement animation for the flickering time travel effect, and some superb sets. It&#8217;s a heck of a lot better than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEiGDncPn_g">my first brick animation</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/eZUtgzxDzGc?list=SP2F2F4EF6F9B25997" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Watching it, I couldn&#8217;t help but think of &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZUtgzxDzGc&amp;list=SP2F2F4EF6F9B25997&amp;index=1">GO MINIMAN GO &#8211; 30 Years: The Story of the Minifigure</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NathanWells">Nathan Wells</a>. It&#8217;s a very similar concept (brief snippets of history played out over a single piece of music with interesting cinematography) executed at a much higher level. It&#8217;s too bad Nathan has seemingly abandoned brick animation to focus on Minecraft machinima, he was one of the greats. (It&#8217;s never too late to rediscover the joys of brick animation, Nathan!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/NXTManiac94">Insomniac Animations</a> has done it again with another painstaking music video that uses facial animation to great effect. His use of camera movements throughout really take this up a notch. My favorite moments include the microscale barge/waterfront at 0:39, the lighting at 1:11, and the slow pull of the curtain at 1:50. The sets are also quite well done.</p>

<p>Last month I got to attend the world premiere of the new LEGO direct-to-video film, &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s a CG animated feature from TT Animation; an offshoot of <a href="http://www.ttgames.com/">Traveller&#8217;s Tales</a>, creators of the LEGO video games.</p>
<p>The &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; screening was held at <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/2013-spring-lego-batman-the-movie/">The Paley Center for Media</a> in Manhattan, and featured a panel of guests including voice actors Troy Baker (Batman), Travis Willingham (Superman), and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), as well as director/producer Jon Burton and director of photography Jeremy Pardon.</p>
<p>Yes, you still need a DP on a production with no real cameras.</p>
<p>When this film was first announced, I heard many LEGO fans cry foul; wondering, &#8220;are they just going to edit the cut-scenes from the LEGO Batman 2 video game together and call it a &#8216;film&#8217;?&#8221; You can all rest easy; &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is more than that. The TT Animation team has put together a solid film that ranks up there with TLG&#8217;s previous home video releases, even surpassing them in some cases (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-The-Adventures-Clutch-Powers/dp/B0030ZIZRC">Clutch Powers</a>).</p>
<p>Which is not to say it&#8217;s a perfect film. &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is TT Animation&#8217;s first venture into film-making, and there are some artifacts from that crossover. You might think I&#8217;m referring to the visuals &#8212; the entire film was made using TT&#8217;s game engine, making it essentially a feature-length machinima piece. But &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; was rendered as a film and not as a real-time video game, so there are noticeable improvements in lighting, staging, animation, and picture quality. The director also called out a few set pieces that had been upgraded to CG LEGO brick-built status, having been simpler CG backgrounds in the game.</p>
<p>(One detail I found particularly amusing was that the production team added dust and scratches to the character textures, to make them seem more like real LEGO minifigs. While we&#8217;re constantly <a href="http://youtu.be/TjH7Iy2VsaQ?t=2m50s">working at Paganomation to remove imperfections</a> from real minifigs, the CG artists on this film spent time putting them in.)</p>
<p>In fact, it was actually the pacing of the film that felt the most like a video game. The story is entertaining and well-told, but it&#8217;s laid out in a strange, level-based way: action scene, story scene, action scene, story scene. This would work well in a video game, but it was a bit distracting at times to feel like I had to &#8220;complete&#8221; the action scenes in order to continue following the story. When the creators brought up the fact that they started working on this film <em>before</em> the LEGO Batman 2 video game, I was not terribly surprised.</p>
<p>Another thing that stuck out as a video game holdover was an unusual amount of violence in the film. Of course, it&#8217;s &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;, so it&#8217;s all very cartoony violence between super-powered heroes and villains, but it still struck me as odd. Nothing you&#8217;d need to shield your kids from, but kind of unnecessary at the same time.</p>
<p>All of this said, I really did enjoy &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;. It has a solid, funny, attention-keeping story, and some great voice acting. I think the voice actors were my favorite part of the film; probably helped in part by the Q&amp;A panel after the film (which also confirmed my belief that Clancy Brown is awesome).</p>

<p>The film had a nice balance between familiar voices, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Clancy Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Rob Paulsen</a>, and folks I&#8217;d never heard of, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684869/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Troy Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992184/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Travis Willingham</a> (although they both have super-long IMDb credits lists, so what do I know).</p>
<p>Stealing the show in the voice department, though, was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772116/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Charlie Schlatter</a> as Robin. The Robin subplot got a bit uncomfortable at times; he&#8217;s not treated very well by some of the characters. But his performance was really funny, and his story has a satisfying arc that has him holding his own with the other heroes by the end of the film.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d definitely recommend checking out &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of the better entries in the LEGO home video pantheon &#8212; probably helped by the decades of development all of these DC characters have had. The Blu-ray/DVD drops May 21st, and you get a nifty Clark Kent minifigure with your purchase, so it&#8217;s win-win.</p>

<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson's_Moonwalker">Michael Jackson&#8217;s Moonwalker</a> for the Sega Genesis (the sprites in this animation are smaller, but more limber than those in the game).</li>
<li>The &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27BfBkRHbs">Fell in Love with a Girl&#8221; music video</a> by Michel Gondry, one of the finest brick animations of all time. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, drop what you&#8217;re doing and watch it now. If you have seen it, go watch it again, because it&#8217;s just that good.

A year ago today, the very <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTOgJdKkQeA">first episode</a> of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MinilifeTV">Minilife TV</a> was released on YouTube. Since then, they have released an episode every Friday (with some breaks between seasons) for a total of 39 episodes. It would take over 3 hours to watch them all back to back (which I highly recommend if you haven&#8217;t already done so). That&#8217;s a staggering amount of animated content, made even more impressive by the fact that it&#8217;s well done. </p>
<p>Their anniversary episode serves as a great entry point for those of you who have never seen an episode before. It introduces the main recurring characters, features a few moments of creative animation (Chris putting himself back together is a highlight, as is everything Archie does), and it ends a sequence of choreographed explosions. It&#8217;s fun and silly and relatively low-stakes, which is a pretty good summary of Minilife TV as a whole. I&#8217;d like to do a more detailed breakdown of the show for this blog at some point in the future, but for now, I just urge you to sit down and watch it. Have some fun, get it done, it&#8217;s time for Minilife TV.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IxqKcetzWbo" height="360" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
My French is <em>très</em> rusty, but even without understanding the language (thankfully, there are English captions) I was impressed by the lip-synced characters in &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/IxqKcetzWbo">Tout le bloc en parle</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MonsieurCaron">MonsieurCaron</a>. While there are an abundance of brick animations that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f848GaFNTc">add digital mouths to minifigs</a>, and a few that swap out physical minifig heads, it is very rare to see brick-built mouth animation. In fact, the only other examples I can think of are &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vsIvU3AZY">Country Buildin&#8217;</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUmIqxGIJo">Little Guys</a>&#8221; by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Paganomation">illustrious co-author</a> of this blog.</p>
<p>The influence of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; on &#8220;Tout le bloc en parle&#8221; is clear not only in the brick-built characters, but also in the use of forced perspective sets for the background. That doesn&#8217;t take anything away from MonsieurCaron&#8217;s considerable accomplishments here. The characters are well-designed and fluidly animated and I found the use of miniland scale (see chapter 4 of <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/01/unofficial-lego-builders-guide-2012/">The Unofficial Lego Builder&#8217;s Guide</a>) characters for the audience particularly inspired. I mention the clear heritage of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; mostly because it&#8217;s a good excuse to promote the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea5Ua_8LJZ0">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Bd9OVspMI">excellent</a> behind-the-scenes videos which show all that goes into to making an animation at this scale.</p>
<p>Also, vive les enseignants!</p>

I was sorting some minifigures this week when I came across one with <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3626bpb172">this head</a>. I immediately had an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny">uncanny</a> moment of disorienting déjà vu. Much like an optical illusion that has been revealed, I could not unsee the unsettling image that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SpastikChuwawa?feature=watch">SpastikChuwawa</a> so succinctly evokes in the classic brick animation, &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpBFN9n9mwo">Mouthstache.</a>&#8221; </p>
<p>There is very little animation in this video, but what is there is crisp and character-driven. I highlight it to remind readers that a compelling concept that is well executed can make a lasting impression. I also had a similar problem with <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3626bpx54">this minifig head</a>, which i initially saw as having a nose above a moustache, but I now see as having an evil smirk above a goatee. Have you even encountered an ambiguous minifig head?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got some leftover Christmas gift cards that you&#8217;re looking to put to good use? Then might I recommend the recently-released second edition of the <a href="http://nostarch.com/legobuilder2">Unofficial LEGO Builders&#8217; Guide</a>, written by <a href="http://www.apotome.com/">Allan Bedford</a> and published by <a href="http://nostarch.com/">No Starch Press.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the first edition as an indispensable part of my library for years now. Without it, there might not have ever been <a href="http://www.paganomation.com/littleguys">a &#8220;Little Guys!&#8221; film</a>, and who knows if I would be here talking to you guys right now! It was with this book that I first learned how to consider the different scales of my LEGO creations, to build curves, and to organize my collection in an efficient manner.</p>
<div id="attachment_912" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-912  " alt="The sample sphere from the ULBG was used as a basis for the character designs in &quot;Little Guys!&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg" width="480" height="392" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg 480w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The sample sphere from the ULBG was used as a basis for the character designs in &#8220;Little Guys!&#8221;</p></div>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in the Book</strong></p>
<p>The Unofficial LEGO Builder&#8217;s Guide is written as both an introduction to the hobby for new LEGO fans and as a reference guide for expert builders and AFOLs. The ten chapters of the book cover the various scales of building, different artistic media (sculptures, mosaics, etc.), and the planning, setup, and execution of whatever MOCs you decide to build.</p>
<div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paganomation/6179650301/in/set-72157627621860773/"><img class=" " alt="Skull Island design grid" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6178/6179650301_df7ac427b2_z.jpg" width="288" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Skull Island design, from Red Brick Saga Pirates of the Caribbean &#8212; design grid and final version</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also the &#8220;Brickopedia&#8221;, an abridged listing of some of the more common LEGO parts and elements, sorted by category. This can be useful if you need a quick reference for a part name or number, or if you&#8217;re just looking for some inspiration for your own brick sorting approach. Granted, a lot of this information is also online, but there&#8217;s something to be said for the condensed economy of having a book in front of you.</p>
<p>Finally, the latter part of the book also showcases LEGO-scaled design grids, with an explanation of how they work as well as links to download and print them yourself. These can be extremely helpful if you&#8217;re trying to design something to fit within a certain space, or if you just want to sketch out an idea before committing it to brick. (We use these all the time over at Paganomation.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Differences in the Second Edition</strong></p>
<p>Having poured over the original book back when it first came out, I was curious to see what changes would be in the new edition. The most obvious one is plastered right on the cover: the second edition does have color photos and instructions. But I was a bit surprised when physically comparing both books&#8230;  the second edition is way thinner!</p>
<div id="attachment_921" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-921  " alt="First edition: approx. 7/8&quot;. Second edition: approx. 1/2&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg" width="600" height="326" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg 600w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes-300x163.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First edition: approx. 7/8&#8243;. Second edition: approx. 1/2&#8243;</p></div>
<p>The new book has 10 chapters, down from 13 in the original. Gone are the sections on sorting and storage, tools for building (a bit on brick separation has been rolled into chapter 2), and Technic building (probably because <a href="http://nostarch.com/technicbuilder">there&#8217;s a whole other new book devoted to it now</a>).</p>
<p>The other differences are a bit more subtle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Brickopedia has been whittled down, from 55 pages in edition 1 to 41 pages in edition 2.</li>
<li>Some brief, potentially redundant bits on scale have been removed from the Microscale chapter.</li>
<li>A section on writing reviews in the &#8220;Beyond Just Bricks&#8221; chapter is gone.</li>
<li>Other assorted edits and minor rearrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I wouldn&#8217;t say these changes hurt the book in any way. The ULBG has just become a more streamlined version of itself&#8230; which is the whole point of putting out a new edition of a book!</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How this relates to Brick Animation</strong></p>
<p>I came to the ULBG from the perspective of both a LEGO fan and an animator. Just like with any form of artistry, there are many tips, tricks and lessons that crossover from one medium to another. Here are a few that I took note of&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 70 talks about Miniland scale facades, and how it can be advantageous to only concentrate on perfecting the parts of your model that will be seen by your audience. Hmm&#8230; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaTIZdTAZ_k">sounds familiar.</a></li>
<li>A section of the Jumbo Elements chapter (p. 78) mentions the importance of testing, tinkering, and trial-and-error to get the results you want.</li>
<li>The chapter on Sculpture talks about using reference material when designing and planning your work (p. 109).</li>
<li>Page 82 has probably the most helpful, universal advice any artist can use: &#8220;Make things only as complicated as they need to be and no more.&#8221; The bottom line? Simple is good.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of LEGO reference books has been steadily increasing in recent years, which makes sense given the flourishing LEGO fan community. Despite being one of the earlier entries in this catalog, I recommend The Unofficial LEGO Builder&#8217;s guide as essential reference material for any brick animator or LEGO fan; young or old, novice or veteran.</p>
<p>(Plus, it&#8217;s now also available as an ebook&#8230; hello, iPad.)</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_(Doctor_Who)">Blink</a>&#8221; is widely regarded as one of the best episodes of Doctor Who. I highly recommend it, it&#8217;s a great self-contained horror story that&#8217;s accesible even if you&#8217;ve never seen any other episodes of Doctor Who. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, you should stop reading this, go watch it on Netflix, and then come back.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;re back, let&#8217;s talk about &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AOo0YihRgw">Don&#8217;t Blink</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/repellingspider">Repelling Spider</a>. While it probably won&#8217;t make much sense to someone who hasn&#8217;t seen &#8220;Blink,&#8221; this brick animation does an excellent job using lighting to convey a mood. The shadowy hallway is the perfect place for an encounter with one of the weeping angels. The short dolly shot of the main character walking in front of back-lit windows is particular noteworthy. The sets are well designed and the animation is crisp. My one criticism would by that the push-in shot on the wedding altar is bumpy. Still, Repelling Spider is to be commended for even attempting such a complex camera move.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MlCHAELHlCKOXFilms">Michael Hickox</a> is something of a phenomenon. With nearly 60,000 YouTube subscribers he is certainly one of the most popular brick animators out there today. <span id="more-814"></span>(The only two I can think of with more subscribers are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Keshen8">Keshen8</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">ForrestFire101</a>.) His fame is well earned, his animations are always well done. He animates simple scenes from everyday life and infuses them with LEGO charm and humor. With straightforward titles such as &#8220;Lego School,&#8221; &#8220;Lego Mini Golf,&#8221; &#8220;Lego Birthday Party&#8221; and, of course, his break-out hit &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUfM0oA8Q8E">Lego Pizza Delivery</a>,&#8221; his animations lay their cards on the table before you even click play. You always know what you&#8217;re going to get with a Michael Hickox production.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FAt7ze-QLQ">LEGO Shopping</a>&#8221; focuses on frustrating minutia that can accompany a simple trip to the store: not finding a good parking space, getting the shopping cart with funky wheels, etc. The most entertaining bits come when a LEGO twist is put on these activities. For instance the frustrated minifig simply rebuilds his car when he can&#8217;t find a parking spot, minifigs partially disassemble themselves to try on different clothes, etc.</p>
<p>Michael Hickox is a great animator with a great command of visual language, his ability to tell a story without any words is enviable. Most of his films are entirely silent save for well placed music and sound effects. So I found it very jarring when the main character turned to the camera at 3:54 to make a comment about LEGO fashion that had already been adequately made visually. The voices continue after that, but I don&#8217;t think they add anything essential to the animation. The old adage &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; applies here, especially since Michael does such a great job showing.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#038;v=5850ssSM2aA#!">LEGO Indiana Jones and the Mystical Gemstone</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kd2apoof">kd2apoof</a> came out of nowhere for me. One of the best things about the brick animation community is when a total stranger from another continent uploads an amazing video that they <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=76414">spent years making</a> and you stumble upon it by chance. It just reinforces the fact that it&#8217;s possible for anyone to make a great animation if they put the work in.</p>
<p>This animation starts off with an homage to the opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egPgU5kAjKE">this shot-for-shot recreation</a>) and then gets into a sequences of fights and chases that are entertaining, if unmotivated. The cinematography and sound design are the most impressive aspects, but the use of facial animation is under. I also like the use of actual rocks and dirt in the sets. Totally lacking in story, this brick animation is on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijpH6an-JIQ">impressive-solely-for-its-technical-achievements</a> end of the spectrum, but still well worth a watch.</p>
<p>P.S. For a brick animation that came out of the blue (for me) from France that is impressive for its story as well as technical achievements, make sure you check out &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmb0qVSd2rY">Henri &#038; Edmond &#8211; Droits d&#8217;auteur</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/studiosepsilon">studiosepsilon</a> if you haven&#8217;t already. It&#8217;s one of my all-time favorites and I&#8217;ve been meaning to do a full review here for a while.</p>

<p>I watched/played &#8220;Lego Adventures&#8221; by MySnailEatsPizza1 back when it first came out and really enjoyed it,<span id="more-769"></span> but I was waiting for the results in the Bricks in Motion Kitchen Sink Contest to be announced before I did shared it here. Now that they&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/15695/bim-2012-kitchen-sink-results/">been announced</a> I can say that this interactive film deserves its first place finish.</p>
<p>Like any good interactive branching narrative, there are lots of different paths you can take in &#8220;Lego Adventures.&#8221; Some are dead ends, some are infinite loops, and all of them are a lot of fun (SPOILER: <span style="color: #ffffff;">you haven&#8217;t really won until you have a pet dragon</span>). The animation and sets in &#8220;Lego Adventures&#8221; are decent and serve their purpose. The story is a bit convoluted (like any good interactive branching narrative), and seems mostly to exist to tie together some disparate set pieces (superhero fight, escaping a military base, a day at the zoo)  the animator envisioned, but in a contest called Kitchen Sink, you can&#8217;t really fault the winner for taking a grab-bag approach. Take some time and play through it, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven&#8217;t seen it before, don&#8217;t miss the archetypical interactive brick animation, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG6yw2IrlI">Ronald has a Spider on His Head</a>,&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SpastikChuwawa">SpastikChuwawa</a>.</p>

This is a great example of how Hero Factory characters lend themselves to more subtle expressions than their minifig counterparts. It also reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter's_Laboratory#The_Justice_Friends">Justice Friends</a>, and anything that reminds me of Dexter&#8217;s Laboratory is a good thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Machine&#8221; is the latest of a <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/09/attack-of-the-50-foot-sibling/">handful</a> of brick animations that blur the line between stop-motion and live action. <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/post/285864/#p285864">According to the animator</a>, it was filmed at 25 frames per second (FPS), and had motion blur added in post-production to make it ever smoother. The short is worth a quick watch for the great cinematography and the inspired animation of the eponymous machine, but I&#8217;m mostly using it to launch into a larger discussion of FPS.</p>
<p>Choosing an FPS is an important part of making an animation, there is a constant balancing act between the smoothness of the animation and time required to make it. An animation set at 5 FPS is bound to look jumpy, but it can still be engaging (this is the frame rate I recommend for beginners). As the FPS increases (10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30), the animation gets smoother, but the time investment to create it rises steeply. Many brick animators settle at 15 FPS as a good balance between smoothness and amount of time invested, but there are a few that venture into those high ranges.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sWwMDbspO7g?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The best cautionary tale in this respect is &#8220;Dr. Jobs and his Scary Laboratory.&#8221; While the single completed episode of this series features some of the smoothest animation I&#8217;ve ever seen in a brick animation, the incompleteness of the remaining segments stands as a testament to the dangers of independent animators pursuing hyper-real frame rates. But let&#8217;s pretend for a minute that time is not an obstacle, what would the optimal frame rate for brick animations be? Is super-smooth, life-like animation the end-all be-all?</p>
<p>Personally, I think very high frame rate animations can feel sterile, and I find attempts to perfectly simulate real motion in animation to be uncanny. I am reminded of Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s essay on <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/55/baudrillard55art.htm">Simulacra and Science Fiction</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no more fiction&#8230; it is the real which has become our true utopia&#8230; presented with transparent precision, but totally lacking substance, having been derealized and hyperrealized.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think? The more frames per second the better? Or is the charm and art of animation precisely in the frames an animator chooses to include (and which to exclude)?</p>

In the magical land of Riigo-Faloo, sharks and clowns hate each other like pirates and ninjas do in <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pirates-vs-ninjas">Internet lore</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Harrison Allen</a> for his informative docudrama about this tragic feud.</p>
<p>What makes &#8220;Sharks and Clowns&#8221; memorable is a creative story told in an interesting way. I love the way elements pop into existence as they are described by the narrator. The animation of the giant squid and cackling Clown King are also highlights. The voices are difficult to understand at certain points and there is some distracting light flicker on the close-up shots, but overall this is a well-done animation with lots of clever moments. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/post/281726/#p281726">discussion on Bricks in Motion</a> to see photos of Harrison&#8217;s lighting set-up for the flames.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;hl=en_US" height="397" width="705" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
A few days ago, my co-author uploaded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgAzSLSioxI">the fourth</a> of five behind-the-scenes videos for four commercials his company produced for the LEGO Group last year, collectively referred to as the &#8220;Red Brick Saga.&#8221; As an animator, these &#8220;making of&#8221; videos are, in some ways, more enjoyable that the four branded shorts. Not only does David explain many of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONUUHhUWVw&amp;feature=BFa&amp;t=3m16s">cool tricks and techniques</a> used in each short, but we get to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjH7Iy2VsaQ&amp;feature=BFa&amp;t=3m58s">his team at work</a>, which helps remind us of the countless painstaking hours that went in to each of these 30-second short videos.</p>
<p>But since this is a review, I should probably talk about the actual videos rather than the behind-the-scenes features. Each 30-second short features a different product line that was on shelves in summer 2011: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGifv_Xs-1Q&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9WvYYrlDAs&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plpp_video">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfwKRq3voQI&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plpp_video">Alien Conquest</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6q9QUH52Ac&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plpp_video">Star Wars</a>. The connecting thread is a red 2&#215;4 brick that flies through each setting indiscriminately wreaking havoc, much like a mischievous pixie. Each video has a madcap pace, rushing from scene to scene with little explanation or closure. Did Jack Sparrow escape safely? Did the humans fight off the alien invasion? No time for answers, the red brick is off on another adventure!</p>
<p>While the shorts may not provide much narrative substance, there is plenty of spectacle to enjoy over repeat viewings. The animation is so fast and buttery smooth, you may not appreciate how good it is until you see some of it slowed down in the behind-the-scenes videos (e.g. the brick-built explosions). The Alien Conquest short is full of great &#8220;blink and you&#8217;ll miss it&#8221; moments like the screaming crowd running away from the tripod walker. The design of each short is clean, professional, and suited to the subject matter. The Star Wars short does an excellent job recreating the iconic Death Star hanger (the lighting of the walls is particularly impressive), and you have to love the tiny bricks circling around the dazed Darth Vader&#8217;s head. Fans of the licensed properties will notice cameos from popular characters. The hallway scene in the Harry Potter short is particularly notable for this, but careful viewers will also notice a white Boba Fett in the Death Star hanger. As always, the Paganomation team uses LEGO bricks in inventive ways, such as a simple hinge brick to represent birds flying in the distance in the Pirates of the Caribbean short.</p>
<p>All told, there&#8217;s a lot of detail packed into a short amount of time. Which is another reason it&#8217;s best to mull over them while watching the behind-the-scenes videos <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjM9cEg2nbM">Barney&#8217;s cherry</a>&#8221; in the Eurobricks <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showforum=120">Brick Flicks and Comics forum</a> last weekend, I started wondering why animations starring Fabuland characters are so frequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">Lynchian</a>. Considering Fabuland was originally marketed at children ages 4-8, there is an alarmingly high occurrence of hallucinatory imagery, adult language, and graphic violence in these animations. There aren&#8217;t many Fabuland animations to begin with, so this list could also be called &#8220;The 7 Best Fabuland Animations,&#8221; but ranking them in order of weirdness is a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>1) &#8220;Mein Herz [My Heart]&#8221; by Pawnshop Orchestra (2006)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oGoXydXBwCo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This music video is probably the most straightforward Fabuland animation out there. A cat and a goat are in love, but far apart. The goat overcomes distance and an octopus to be reunited with his true love. Short, sweet, and barely weird.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; by FilmFair (1987)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dGFFmcu6mTc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>&#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; was an officially licensed series to promote the Fabuland sets. However, rather than using actual Fabuland products, the characters are made of clay, allowing for a much greater range of expression. This series is standard kid show fare; each episode presents a small challenge that is overcome in a friendly manner. The only weirdness here is intrinsic to the Fabuland product line: it takes place in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry">Scarreyesque</a> village of anthropomorphic animals. But as we all know, overly-cheerful facades often harbor horrible secrets. (There are plenty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEC4389AD9D69F3D">more episodes</a> for those who want more.)</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.nifeislife.com/orzoro-soluble-120g-p-777.html">Nestlé Orzoro</a> Commercial (1985)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-ixHXylZ8?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>In this frenetic 15-second commercial, a pig and a panda pull back a curtain to reveal a forest. In the forest, six Fabulanders pop out of a tree and wave before disappearing again. But the forest was just another curtain! Some characters fly through the air to place logos! Another curtain! Oh look, it&#8217;s the product! How did the pig get trapped inside? No time to worry about that, he&#8217;s saved by a parrot on a trapeze! Another curtain, everybody bows! What was that commercial about?</p>
<h3>4) &#8220;Barney&#8217;s Cherry&#8221; by Thauka Kuki Team Entertainment (2012)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TjM9cEg2nbM?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Even after watching this film half a dozen times, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite &#8220;solved&#8221; it. This animation is very clearly a riddle on multiple levels. Firstly, there is the riddle presented via intertitles, which the viewer is given time to ponder before being presented with an answer. However, that answer doesn&#8217;t really satisfy, and it&#8217;s clear that there are visual clues throughout that point to the real solution (the very first titlescreen makes sure we know this).</p>
<p>But even after I figured out that (highlight to reveal spoilers) <span style="color: #ffffff;">Bonnie is cheating on Ed with Barney and actually wanted to free Barney, but was tricked by the statues watering the flowers</span>, I still don&#8217;t understand why the horses on the side of the screen turn into different animals at 0:47, why the characters spend so much time looking at the sword and cherry, or what random flashes of light are all about. But because the film is well animated and has a good score, I don&#8217;t mind revisiting it again and again.</p>

<h3>5) &#8220;A day in the life of&#8230;&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/complessogasparo?feature=watch">Complesso Gasparo</a> (2007)<br />

<p>Following the advice of a real-life chihuahua, a Fabuland monkey breaks the shackles of his buttoned-down life. He then proceeds to break-dance everywhere, deface a wall with obscene graffiti, take off his head, and attack a pig on a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>6) &#8220;The Franky Job&#8221; by David M Pickett (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSApqbyCJM4?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Rather than review my own film, I&#8217;m going to quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>&#8216; Bricks in Motion <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/films/view/126/">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s essentially a noir private-eye film, but at its core is laced with hidden subtexts of racism and bigotry. The film is at times humorous, thought-provoking, and disturbing, mixed together in a blend that would seem abstract (and is for the most part), but seems to come together somehow at the end.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) &#8220;Fabuland&#8221; by Grégory Métay et Olivier Couëllant (2000)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OsZAu0Y_LBo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This is the quintessential Fabuland animation and deserves 10 times as many views as it has. It features the most fully realized busy Fabuland town, and music and voice acting that perfectly fit the style of the characters. There&#8217;s a lot to admire here from  an animation perspective; the swaying palm trees are my personal favorite. Despite not knowing French, I felt like I understood the story perfectly thanks to the great visual storytelling. But why did I put this as the weirdest animation? Let&#8217;s just say it takes some very surprising turns.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: &#8220;<a href="http://brickzone.net/fabuland_housewives.html">The Fabuland Housewives</a>&#8221; by Mark Larson</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" title="Fabuland Housewives by Mark Larson" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg 650w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-268x200.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Though not animated, this hilarious webcomic by Mark Larson is an impressive feat that must have taken countless hours to script, design, photograph, and code. Like the ABC show that inspired it, it is chock full of scandal, gruesome murders, and shocking twists. However, it&#8217;s also uproariously funny and well worth a read if you&#8217;ve got a few hours to kill.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Why are Fabuland animations so weird (or did I exaggerate how weird they are)? Are there any major works I missed?</p>

<p>I think most LEGO fans are familiar with the story of Ole Kirk Christiansen, and how The LEGO Group originally developed from his small woodworking company in the early-mid 20th century. It&#8217;s been well-documented in a number of official books, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Lego-Book-Modellers/dp/0751359483/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+ultimate+lego+book">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Years-LEGO-Brick-Christian-Humberg/dp/3898808874/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897635&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lego+50+year">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Book-Daniel-Lipkowitz/dp/0756666937/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897556&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+lego+book">this one</a>.</p>
<p>But now this history is available in a new format &#8212; last Friday marked the 80th anniversary of The LEGO Group, and to honor the occasion, they released <a href="http://youtu.be/NdDU_BBJW9Y">a short film</a> detailing the company&#8217;s evolution. While it is an animated film, it&#8217;s neither stop-motion nor LEGO animation, so I won&#8217;t be approaching it with all of the review aspects we&#8217;d normally cover on this site. But I did want to talk about it, because&#8230; it&#8217;s a long, drawn-out mess.</p>
<p>From the get-go, there&#8217;s something oddly disorienting about the way &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; is told. We start by fading from a (CGI) LEGO-brick-built edifice to a real (CGI) building, as we move back in time to Billund, Denmark in 1932. The pleasant voice-over narration tells us that we are following Ole Kirk Christiansen&#8217;s story; and, as a man exits the building on-screen, we assume this must be Ole himself.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s one of his workers, and about 15 seconds pass before we realize this and meet the real Ole. Huh?</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-235 alignright" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Ole" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Ole" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-910x1024.jpg" width="700" height="787" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-910x1024.jpg 910w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-266x300.jpg 266w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-700x787.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>The story continues, and there&#8217;s a match cut between the worker exiting and Ole sitting down with his wife, further confusing the two characters (and the audience). Ole laments his work situation, and his wife tries to cheer him up with some dialogue that adds absolutely nothing to the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s hard to understand. But at least now&#8230; it can&#8217;t get much worse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Time passes with another dissolve, and the lighthearted narrator informs us &#8220;it did get worse!&#8221; &#8212; Ole&#8217;s wife, a character who had a total screen time of 15 seconds, is now dead. The above quote is her only dialogue in the film. So much for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekov%27s_gun">Chekhov&#8217;s Gun.</a></p>
<p>(Admittedly, I can&#8217;t really summarize it better than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?threaded=1&amp;v=NdDU_BBJW9Y&amp;page=2">YouTube commenter Evan Buchholz</a>: &#8220;Jesus, that was the most cheery &#8216;but it did get worse&#8217; I ever heard.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Thus, in the first one-and-a-half minutes, we&#8217;re already introduced to the three major issues with the entire film:</p>
<ol>
<li>Narration that doesn&#8217;t match the tone of the story</li>
<li>Confusing shot composition and blocking</li>
<li>Dialogue that restates information we&#8217;ve already gotten from the picture and narration</li>
</ol>
<p>And we still have around 14 minutes left to sit through.</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought maybe this film had been translated into English from another language. LEGO is a Danish company, after all, and a multinational brand. But the lip sync here seems to match the dialogue, and the credits list the &#8220;Original Voice Cast&#8221;; so I&#8217;ll assume &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; was created in English first.</p>
<p>The majority of TLG&#8217;s animated releases &#8212; save for <a href="http://www.brickset.com/search/?query=dvd">the direct-to-DVD films</a> &#8212; are either silent or have voice-over, which I believe serves to make them more universal. (Out of all <a href="http://www.paganomation.com/work/commissioned/">the work we&#8217;ve done for TLG at Paganomation</a>, not one film has been dialogue-based.) Strangely enough, the next minute or so of the film follows this approach pretty well. There&#8217;s some nice <del>animation</del> motion capture of Ole interacting with his sons, and the development of <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Duck">the classic LEGO duck.</a></p>
<p>But as soon as the &#8220;Wholesaler&#8221; character arrives, we&#8217;re back to clunky dialogue. &#8220;Now there&#8217;s finally someone who can see the opportunities in what we&#8217;re doing!&#8221; Thank you, we know; we just saw that.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-237" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Wholesaler" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Wholesaler" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-1024x576.jpg" width="700" height="393" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-700x393.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>These bizarre inconsistencies continue throughout the film; again, most prominently in the voice-over. Even though we see the company&#8217;s ups and downs as the years pass, the narrator never wavers from his chipper delivery of exposition. I attribute this to what&#8217;s sometimes known as &#8220;LEGO humor&#8221; &#8212; the sense given through TLG&#8217;s cinematic releases that everything is whimsical and fun, even when the information being presented clearly contradicts this idea.</p>
<p>The most bewildering moment of narration comes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdDU_BBJW9Y&amp;t=09m45s">at around the 10 minute mark</a>; when, out of nowhere, the narrator says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone thought that was a good idea, and we were placed on the sofa, with all the presents and flowers around us!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait&#8230; &#8220;we&#8221;?! Who&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8221;? Up until this point, the narrative style has been <em>third-person omniscient;</em> with the voice-over recounting the story, in retrospect, from outside the world the film takes place in. Now, all of a sudden, we&#8217;re hearing a <em>first-person</em> account? Who is talking? I literally rewound to the beginning of the film, just to make sure I hadn&#8217;t missed some important introduction. I hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And then, once again, this left-field change is immediately disregarded, and it&#8217;s another minute of run-time before we hear the narrator refer to himself as &#8220;I&#8221; again. Eventually, the ending of the film suggests the narrator is Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen &#8212; I say &#8220;suggests&#8221; because we never hear his name, and he never introduces himself to the audience.</p>
<p>This is the overall problem with &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; &#8212; it pays no attention to <em>the language of film;</em> the rules that have developed over time so that audiences can clearly follow a story. You can twist and bend these rules to do some interesting things, but when you blatantly ignore them, your film starts to get weird.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to tell a story from a first-person perspective, introduce the storyteller from the beginning, so that we know who&#8217;s talking to us. If you&#8217;re going to have dialogue, make sure that it serves a purpose; otherwise, cut it out entirely. Make sure you&#8217;re clear on the tone of your film &#8212; tone, <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/">as Plinkett reminds us</a>, is how a film <em>feels</em>. Either make a film that&#8217;s entirely upbeat, and excise the depressing historical bits; or, tell a story that flows naturally from happy to sad, and have the rest of the film&#8217;s elements match and support that.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-239" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; guy" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; guy" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-1024x576.jpg" width="700" height="393" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-700x393.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, have an idea of who your audience is &#8212; who you&#8217;re making your film <em>for</em>. The &#8220;LEGO humor&#8221; concept I mentioned above is a way to have films appeal directly to KFOLs; the target LEGO demographic. The confusing, slipshod way this film is made negates that idea; culminating with the narrator discussing &#8220;children&#8221; at the film&#8217;s finale, as if no children were watching.</p>
<p>Which, after 15+ minutes, I can&#8217;t say I really blame them. This film could have been half the running time and told the same story more effectively. &#8220;Only the Best is Good Enough&#8221;? Eh, maybe next time.</p>

<p>The 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London may have ended last weekend, but you can relive the highlights in LEGO form, thanks to the Guardian&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;feature=plcp">Brick by Brick</a>&#8221; series of animations. While I am not a sports buff <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXEPnKSxGY&amp;feature=youtu.be">myself</a>, even I can appreciate the amount of work that went into creating these videos.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really interesting to me about &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; are the constraints under which it was produced. As outlined in the above behind-the-scenes video, nine animations were created by a small team in the span of two weeks. Because of <a href="http://kotaku.com/5933126/a-news-broadcast-reenacted-olympic-highlights-with-lego?tag=lego">broadcasting restrictions</a>, news organizations can&#8217;t in many cases show video footage of Olympics events, so these brick animations stand in for the video. Considered as a form of sports journalism, &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a delightful, creative solution to a frustrating problem. It&#8217;s also cool that brick animation has become so widely embraced that it gets casually integrated into the operations of a major news outlet.</p>
<p>However, when judged as examples of the brick animation form, these videos are less remarkable. The low frame rate (about 5 FPS by my eye) makes the animation look choppy, and a lot of time is killed showing still images. Again, this is understandable given the constraints, but still leaves little to recommend. Those interested in these animations only for the animation should stick to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzu-kb34ZYk&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">highlights video</a> or the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt5wB_xxyQ&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video">gymnastics video</a>.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports/videos">LEGO Sport Champions</a>,&#8221; one of the earliest examples of brick animation.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U9u57UOh1Sc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a series of play-by-play recreations of real-life sports events, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; presents whimsical takes on traditional sports that frequently break the laws of physics. For example, in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0kkgmPQgo&amp;feature=plcp">hockey short,</a> one of the players briefly turns into a snake, and the &#8220;winner&#8221; of the match is a dog from the audience. Rather than using minifigures, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; favors expressive, brick-built characters. While &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; features English narration to explain the action, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is voiceless, and features a strong score that responds to the action.</p>
<p>As an official series of animations commissioned by the LEGO group, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is one of the few brick animations that can safely be said to take place in LEGOLAND*. It&#8217;s a place where animals and inanimate objects have as much agency as people do (the scoreboard wins the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST-tGPrltG4&amp;feature=plcp">gymnastics</a> competition), and where everything can be easily taken apart and recombined (when two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Ln9hkXPlc&amp;feature=plcp">F1 racers</a> collide, their cars combine into a giant striped race car which they decide to co-pilot). I want to live there.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sports Champions&#8221; weightlifting video above is probably the one that comes closest to having a story. It follows a gorilla as it escapes from the circus and heads across town to investigate (and then compete in) a weight-lifting competition. In addition to giving a brief glimpse of some wonderful large scale town buildings, this video is chock-full of creative moments. For instance, when the two circus workers realize the gorilla has escaped, one of them turns into a dog to track its scent. The scenes in the massage room where the gorilla and masseur take turns molding each other into strange shapes are prime examples of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Exaggeration">exaggeration</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>All seven of the &#8220;Sport Champion&#8221; videos are must-sees (and it will only take about half an hour to watch them all). Like the best brick animations, there is so much going on that you will want to watch them multiple times. Enjoy!</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m using LEGOLAND here in an anachronistic sense to refer to the <a href="http://www.peeron.com/catalogs/1982/medium/1/">fictional universe</a> that LEGO characters exist in, as opposed to the real-life theme parks with the same name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you rather be Spider-Man or a Jedi Knight?&#8221;</p>
<p>This impossible question was once posed to me by a friend who knew that my geeky obsession with LEGO was rivaled only by similar obsessions with Star Wars and Spider-Man. So you can imagine the kind of loop-de-loops my brain did in 2003, when LEGO Spider-Man sets first appeared on the shelves next to LEGO Star Wars sets. While I treasure the few Spider-Man sets I was able to buy then, my favorite thing to come out of the LEGO Spider-Man license is &#8220;Spider-Man: The Peril of Doc Ock&#8221; by <a href="http://www.spiteyourface.com/">Spite Your Face Productions</a>.<span id="more-87"></span></p>
<p>For those of you who can&#8217;t remember the internet before YouTube, brick animations used to be something of a rarity. Spite Your Face Productions was one of the <a href="http://www.spiteyourface.com/?p=210">early pioneers</a> in this respect, and their work helped inspire a generation of aspiring young animators. In the summer of 2004, I had just finished my first major brick animation (an incoherent, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9BEDC81DEEC95CE&amp;feature=plcp">45-minute</a>, pop culture mash-up), and was starting production on a longer, slightly more coherent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL66B0A03F2BEAC3B6&amp;feature=plcp">sequel</a>. With its buttery-smooth character animation, &#8220;Doc Ock&#8221; became the ideal to which I still aspire.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-91" title="docock1" alt="Doctor Octopus holds an elephant in the air" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock1.png" width="700" height="282" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock1.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock1-300x120.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Doctor Octopus is terrorizing New York City until Spider-Man arrives to save the day. Somewhere in the middle, an elephant shows up. The &#8220;two characters fight&#8221; plot is, sadly, a very common one in brick animations. With no narrative arc to speak of, these films tend to live or die on the quality of their technical aspects and the popularity of the characters fighting. &#8220;Doc Ock&#8221; not only excels in both of these categories, but also manages to fit a good deal of humor in, making it enjoyable for a broad audience.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<h3><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock2.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-92" title="docock2" alt="Various screenshots from &quot;Spider-Man: The Peril of Doc Ock&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock2.png" width="240" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock2.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/docock2-187x300.png 187w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></a></h3>
<p>Since &#8220;Doc Ock&#8221; was commissioned by LEGO and Sony to promote the release of &#8220;Spider-Man 2&#8221; and the <a href="http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Spider-Man&amp;year=2004">associated LEGO product line</a>, it incorporates both the perpetual sunset of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=spider-man+2&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=5M8nUPG4G6eZyAHI-4GIBw&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=597&amp;sei=S9AnUL_KIaSsyAGo84DIBQ#um=1&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US%3Aofficial&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=spider-man+2+poster&amp;oq=spider-man+2+poster&amp;gs_l=img.3..0j0i5i33j0i5i33i24.30415.32001.0.32226.7.7.0.0.0.0.206.522.1j2j1.4.0...0.0...1c.tpMg63TaaPw&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=7d9de27aff9a326d&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=597">movie posters</a> and characters, vehicles, and buildings from the official LEGO sets.</p>
<p>After a few detailed establishing shots of New York City, the animation progresses to more simplistic sets that keep the focus on the action. By the final showdown, all traces of the skyline have vanished.</p>
<p>The orange and purple lighting schemes bring out some really nice hues in the tan and bley buildings, and are very flattering to Doctor Octopus. The lighting is not so kind to Spider-Man, who occasionally looks jaundiced. Occasional lens flares reinforce the connection to the movie poster.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Doctor Octopus&#8217;s tentacles are the real stars of this short, and four of the reasons I can watch it again and again. They are in near-constant motion and move with amazing speed and fluidity. Repeated viewings are necessary to appreciate the nuances of their movement (and to see all the humorous objects they grab).</p>
<p>Spider-Man is also well animated; his web-slinging in particular is as fluid as possible given the constraints of the minifigure&#8217;s joints. One of my favorite moments is when he scrambles behind the speeding train car.</p>
<p>There are a fair deal of special effects used in the short; many of the wide shots of the city are composites of multiple shots. Now that I have a keener eye, these shots look flatter and less impressive to me than they did eight years ago. However, they serve their purpose, and given the constraints this short was produced under, it is understandable why SYFP went this route as opposed to building a massive New York City set.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>Since there is no dialogue, the music and sound effects do a lot of heavy lifting in this short. The score by Jason Graves responds perfectly to every action on screen, switching quickly and effortlessly between epic, antic, and frantic. The sound effects are similarly well-matched to the animation. This is a perfect example of what sound design should do &#8212; punctuate the animation without distracting from it.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Nearly a decade after it was released, &#8220;Doc Ock&#8221; is still one of the finest examples of the brick animation form. What it lacks in story, it makes up for in animation prowess. It blends action and humor in a way that has become characteristic of official LEGO animations, and remains popular in LEGO fan animations. It is also notable for its place in the history of brick animation, and well worth your viewing time.</p>
<p>And for those who would rather be a Jedi Knight than Spider-Man, don&#8217;t miss &#8220;<a href="http://www.spiteyourface.com/?p=70">Star Wars: The Han Solo Affair</a>,&#8221; also by Spite Your Face Productions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with animation and film making for a long time now. As a kid, I was first inspired by things like <a href="http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Muppet_Wiki">The Muppets</a>, <a href="http://www.wallaceandgromit.com">Wallace and Gromit</a>, <a href="http://www.starwars.com">Star Wars</a>, and anything from <a href="http://www.animateclay.com/index.php/articles/73-historic-videos/191-will-vinton-studios-portland">Will Vinton Studios</a>. These classic creations piqued my interest in stop-motion, sculpture, character animation, and general weirdness. I started pursuing these interests using the medium I knew best &#8212; LEGO bricks.</p>
<p>As my study of these things continued into college, I struggled with whether or not to make <a href="http://www.paganomation.com/littleguys">my thesis film</a> a LEGO film. Was it practical? Would audiences see it as a gimmick? Could it even be done? Fortunately, I was able to find a few prior examples of fantastic, minifig-free brick animation, which solidified my decision and helped inspire me further. One of these films was &#8220;ROBOTA&#8221; by Marc Beurteaux.</p>
<p><span id="more-28"></span></p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>(Spoilers to follow.)</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-65" title="&quot;ROBOTA&quot;" alt="&quot;ROBOTA&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota1-1024x768.jpg" width="700" height="525" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota1-300x224.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota1-268x200.jpg 268w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota1-700x525.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>ROBOTA tells the story of, well, Robota; a wheelchair-bound automaton wandering through a futuristic, grey-scale city. Robota dreams of having her legs repaired, but can&#8217;t afford to; so she bets her panhandled cash on a robot cockfight. Eventually, Robota makes her way to a somewhat eccentric robot hospital, where her dream of getting new legs comes true&#8230; sort of.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The world of ROBOTA is well-defined from the get-go, starting with some great establishing shots of the bleak, mechanical city. The lighting is stark and moody, adding to the atmosphere, and a few of the vehicles and sets have some neat built-in lighting.</p>
<p>The character designs in ROBOTA are really clever. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-66" title="&quot;ROBOTA&quot; bartender" alt="&quot;ROBOTA&quot; bartender" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota2-300x224.jpg" width="300" height="224" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota2-300x224.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota2-268x200.jpg 268w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/still_robota2-700x525.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />Even though 95% of the &#8216;bots are built completely in grey, they each have a uniqueness, and feature plenty of NPU. Look for the guy with a boxing bell for a head, the one-legged droid on crutches, and the bartender&#8217;s SNOT noggin. (Also, who knew robots could have nipples?)</p>
<p>In fact, the grey color scheme of the robot characters is used to great advantage at many points in the film, particularly when color comes into play at the cockfight. Each of the robot birds has a distinct color scheme, and since there is no dialogue in the film, the betting on the fights is conveyed through the use of colored tickets used by the characters. A fight between blue and yellow robot birds stands out all the more when contrasted with a grey robot audience.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>The animation in ROBOTA is impressive. There&#8217;s lots of great subtlety from each of the characters, especially Robota herself. Her arms are <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogList.asp?catType=P&amp;catString=45">Classic Space arm pieces</a>, giving her gestures flexibility and variety.</p>
<p>The secondary robot characters are well-animated, too. What&#8217;s nice is that, for the most part, these background &#8216;bots are rigged only to be able to accomplish what&#8217;s needed for the shot &#8212; whether it&#8217;s reacting, fighting, or just subtle head turns. On the film&#8217;s commentary track, director Marc Beurteaux talks about how the characters were rigged with the intent of solving every animation problem in the simplest way possible, and it shows.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-54 alignleft" title="&quot;ROBOTA&quot; robot bird" alt="&quot;ROBOTA&quot; robot bird" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RobotaPIX.jpg" width="350" height="337" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RobotaPIX.jpg 350w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/RobotaPIX-300x288.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px" />The robot birds are pretty sweet, and despite having click-jointed legs, they seem to move with a great fluidity and style. The flying shots of them are well done, with supports being hidden as opposed to masked out in post-production (impressive!).</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> a couple of post-production visual effects in the film, but none of them really stand out or feel poorly integrated (except maybe for one breaking bottle). The film is primarily a stop-motion piece, and there are some great in-camera panning and trucking shots, which are simple but well-executed.</p>
<h3>Sound</h3>
<p>The sound design for ROBOTA works in much the same way &#8212; it&#8217;s simple, effective, and serves the film well. There&#8217;s enough of a variety of robot droning, buzzing, and beeping to make Ben Burtt proud.</p>
<p>For the most part, the music is also electronic sounding, save for the finale song &#8220;Hooray, Hooray!&#8221; by Pat Bowman. It&#8217;s a more melodic, almost musical theater sounding piece (apparently, at one point, this film was supposed to end with a dance number). While tonally different, it still somehow fits the mood of the overall film, and ends things on a lighthearted note.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>ROBOTA has one of the traits that I believe any LEGO animated film<em> should</em> have &#8212; that it would have been a great film whether it was made using LEGO bricks or not. ROBOTA creates an immersive world, tells an engaging story, and is totally worth repeated viewings to catch all the creative details.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s got robots. I can&#8217;t recommend it enough.</p>
<h3>Where to watch this film</h3>
<p>ROBOTA made the festival rounds in the mid-2000s, winning a few awards in the process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Canadian Film, Resfest 2005</li>
<li>Outstanding Achievement Award, New Haven Underground Film Festival, 2006</li>
<li>Best Art Direction, Chicago Short Film Festival, 2006</li>
</ul>
<p>ROBOTA<em> </em>used to be available on DVD via robotafilm.com, but it appears that website is no longer in existence. It is available to view <a href="http://youtu.be/vkraLbPTO5s">on YouTube. </a></p>
<p>Marc Beurteaux&#8217;s website also seems to have disappeared, though you can still view a few of his blog entries on the <a href="http://www.wildsound-filmmaking-feedback-events.com/marc_beurteaux_blog.html">WILDsound Film Festival website.</a></p>
