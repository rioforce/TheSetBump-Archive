				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to follow <a href="http://www.legobatman.com/">Batman</a>? And maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ARp9KBtzP4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I was all set to write a review of &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie&#8221; way back in February, before the film even came out. The first of 2017&#8217;s two sequels to <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a> focused on not only a beloved character from the first film, but on one of <a href="http://fandomania.com/100-greatest-fictional-characters-1-batman/">the most popular fictional characters of all time</a>. Batman is a pop culture institution. So is LEGO. Combining them is a sure thing.</p>
<p>And for the most part, that&#8217;s accurate. The film did well; it&#8217;s got a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_batman_movie/">90% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The product line was robust and full of <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/theme-The-LEGO-Batman-Movie">beautifully designed sets</a> and characters. There was even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Batman-Movie-Making/dp/1465456619">a lovely Making-of book</a> for the film (though it&#8217;s really more a collection of concept art book than it is a comprehensive look behind-the-scenes).</p>
<p>So why did I find it so hard to write anything about this film? Why didn&#8217;t I have the same vigor I had while writing <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">my in-depth review of the first film</a>?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s because a &#8220;LEGO Movie&#8221; is no longer the gamble it once was. This sequel was another fun, well-made film in the LEGO Movie universe, with a great cast and some wonderful designs. But unlike the original, the marketing for this film definitely had the vibe of &#8220;yeah, come on&#8230; we know you&#8217;re all gonna come see this.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, the &#8220;Batman&#8221; of it all is nothing new, either. All of the familiar motifs are here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gang of Gotham&#8217;s worst criminals (led by The Joker, natch) is loose in the city, wreaking havoc and conspiring against our heroes,</li>
<li>The Gotham City government and police force struggle with this excessive amount of crime. And, of course,</li>
<li>Millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat man to clean up the town and work through the pain of losing his parents at a young age.</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper, this might sound like a recipe for a dull film. But as with the first <em>LEGO Movie, </em>what makes it all work is a wonderful dose of humor, self-awareness, and an obvious love for the property. <em>LEGO Batman</em> is definitely a fun watch, and if you liked the original, you&#8217;ll probably like this one, too.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this all means that I don&#8217;t much else to say about <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em> itself.Â Dave Pickett and I <a href="https://youtu.be/3ARp9KBtzP4">talked at length about it on my YouTube channel</a> back in February (see above), if you&#8217;re interested in some further random discussion.</p>
<p>However, I will say this: I am curious to see what comes next, given the fact that we&#8217;ll have &#8220;<a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/lego-ninjago-movie">The LEGO Ninjago Movie</a>&#8221; to watch and think through a few months from now. As far as IPs go, <em>Ninjago</em> is certainly no <em>Batman</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>You can catch <em>The LEGO Batman Movie </em>on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUI1NPD?ref=dvm_us_tvod_sl_g_TtlM_59|c_201238940585_m_Sjvqe40l-dc_s__">DVD, Blu-ray,</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-lego-batman-movie/id1197505667">iTunes,</a> and elsewhere.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1714 alignleft" alt="2013 LEGO Entertainment Guide cover" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-210x300.jpg" width="210" height="300" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-210x300.jpg 210w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-719x1024.jpg 719w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-700x996.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm.jpg 1580w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>I was intrigued to find this pamphlet tucked away inside the November-December 2013 issue of the LEGO Club Magazine. Billed as the &#8220;Special LEGO Video Guide&#8221;, it purports to feature the &#8220;top 2013 LEGO videos, free online games, apps, and more!&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, it&#8217;s just one big advertisement for LEGO multimedia content (much like what the Club Magazine itself is for LEGO toys). But it definitely points towards increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content, most likely in preparation for <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">the release of The LEGO Movie next February.</a><span id="more-1698"></span></p>
<p>And since &#8220;increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content&#8221; is our middle name here, I figured I&#8217;d take a second to walk you guys through this &#8220;Entertainment Guide&#8221; brochure&#8230;</p>
<h2>The Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cover is made up to look like an &#8220;Entertainment Weekly&#8221; magazine, both in terms of layout and font choice for the title. In fact, I&#8217;m kind of surprised they were able to get away with that. Parody&#8230; I guess?</li>
<li>Chase McCain is holding a LEGO Clapboard tile, which says &#8220;Awards!&#8221; on it. I&#8217;m not sure what that&#8217;s referring to, since there are no awards given or listed on the pages within. It almost feels like a movie industry word association game. &#8220;What are some other Hollywood-related words&#8230; how about &#8216;Awards&#8217;?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 1-2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first spread is titled &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos!&#8221;, though based on the content being presented, that&#8217;s a pretty arbitrary label. All the videos in this pamphlet are official LEGO releases, which means they&#8217;re somewhat limited in scope. How or why these particular videos were chosen to be the &#8220;top&#8221; videos, it doesn&#8217;t say, but there was basically nothing noteworthy I hadn&#8217;t seen before.</li>
<li>Seeing the Paganomation-produced LEGO <a href="http://youtu.be/PXPA0fEU1aA">Superman</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Rv4Mmkokexc">Iron Man</a> videos listed in there was a nice touch, though.</li>
<li>The only new content to catch my eye was not a video at all, but a notice for a &#8220;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">NEW FREE LEGO TV APP</a>&#8221; available on iTunes. This was the first I had ever heard of such an app existing; though, thanks to similar notices on subsequent pages, it was not the last.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 3-4</h2>
<ul>
<li>More of the &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos&#8221;, including the &#8220;first trailer&#8221; for The LEGO Movie. <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">Didn&#8217;t the second trailer already come out?</a></li>
<li>I can appreciate how repetitive it must be to write short blurbs about so many conceptually similar LEGO videos, but some of the grammar/sentence structure in this brochure is kinda wonky. &#8220;How did it go from idea to finished LEGO Specials?&#8221; How indeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 5-6</h2>
<ul>
<li>These pages focus on LEGO City video/game media from 2013.Â Page 6 is solely devoted to advertising a new LEGO City game for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Page 5 does focus on videos; though oddly, they&#8217;re all CGI entries. What&#8217;s weirder are the &#8220;milestone&#8221;-type captions on a few of the thumbnail images:Â &#8220;First Appearance of Dalmatian Firedog&#8221;! Oh&#8230; okay. &#8220;Most Minifigures in a Single Video!&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s not really true; it&#8217;s CG, so technically there are no minifigures in that video.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 7-8</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pages 7 and 8 feature an ad for the Cartoon Network &#8220;Legends of Chima&#8221; CG series, which I have yet to check out in any capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 9-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>The spread on pages 9 and 10 is entitled, &#8220;Mini Movies&#8230; Big Creativity!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rather than focusing on specific video entries, these blurbs talk more generally about a few LEGO video genres &#8212; Microsquare (a series of Master Builder how-to videos), LEGO CGI Animation (technically a medium, not a genre), and Seasonal Shorts (Adventures of Max, the Brick-a-Brack Bunch, etc.).</li>
<li>More strange sentences: &#8220;Featuring the Brick-a-Brack Bunch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="â¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Â on zany adventures, look for these videos during holidays and when the seasons change.&#8221; &#8220;A Club Member favorite, &#8216;Adventures of Max,&#8217; from the LEGO Club TV Show have been an online mainstay for a few years, following the LEGO Club mascot on adventures that take him under the sea, into outer space, and follow him through almost every LEGO line.&#8221;</li>
<li>And another ad touting &#8220;2 ways to watch: catch them all at <a href="http://www.lego.com/clubvideos">LEGO.com/clubvideos</a> OR Ask your parents to download the FREE LEGO TV APP on your iPhone or tablet.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yet another ad for Legends of Chima.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest takeaway from this brochure is the existence of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">the LEGO TV mobile app</a>, which I think is pretty cool. Anything that gets LEGO videos further out into the public eye can only be a good thing, I think.</li>
<li>However, there are some inconsistencies. For example, our aforementioned LEGO Iron Man short is nowhere to be found on the LEGO TV app, despite the claim that all videos shown in the guide are available to watch on the app. I wonder how many other videos might have been lost in the void.</li>
<li>The other interesting thing I discovered via this brochure is the existence of yet another outlet for LEGO Video content. When the blurb mentioned checking out club videos on the LEGO website, I assumed it was talking about <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO Club Videos page.</a>Â In fact, it&#8217;s talking about something else entirely: <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">a Videos page on LEGO.com itself.</a></li>
<li>This newer videos page does seem to be more thorough than the Club Videos page ever was; though, on this new page, there is again <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos/themes/club">a subcategory for Club Videos</a>, effectively rendering the separate Club Videos page outmoded and redundant.</li>
<li>I am again baffled by the ways in which The LEGO Group continues <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/official-lego-youtube-channel/">the fracturing of their video releases</a>; especially when it&#8217;s clear from this brochure that they want more people to check out said videos. Now we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lego">the official LEGO YouTube channel</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/legoclubtv">the old (dead) LEGO Club TV channel</a>, <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the Club Videos page</a>, <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO.com Videos page</a>, the LEGO Movie Maker App &#8220;Movie Gallery&#8221; section, the LEGO TV app, ReBrick.com&#8230; sheesh.</li>
<li>Why not just have ONE central location and drive all the traffic there? I get wanting to have as many people as possible see the video content itself, but this just feels like a big mess. I want to be able to come back to the same place every time and see all the video content there is; not have to figure out which videos were uploaded where, when, and then try to keep tabs on all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, what did you guys think of theÂ The 2013 LEGO Club Entertainment Guide? Are you going to check out the LEGO TV app?</p>

<p>A host of new LEGO film and TV content has been added to Netflix. It&#8217;s all CG stuff, but cool nonetheless.</p>
<p><span id="more-1538"></span></p>
<p>Among the new titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_Mask_of_Light_The_Movie/60029645?trkid=2361637">first</a> <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_2_Legends_of_Metru_Nui/70002933?trkid=2361637">two</a> Bionicle movies (joining <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_3_Web_of_Shadows/70038640?trkid=2361637">the third one</a> that was already available)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Atlantis/70275713?trkid=2361637">LEGO Atlantis</a>Â 22-minute short that aired on Cartoon Network a while back</li>
<li>A Hero Factory TV show two-parter called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Hero_Factory_Breakout/70276202?trkid=2361637">&#8220;Breakout&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Ninjago_Masters_of_Spinjitzu/70252973?trkid=7203170">Season 1 of Ninjago</a></li>
<li>A 22-minute LEGO Friends short called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Friends_New_Girl_in_Town/70275714?trkid=2361637">&#8220;New Girl In Town&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, I&#8217;ve only managed to watch the Friends and Atlantis shorts. &#8220;New Girl In Town&#8221; has about as bland of a story as you&#8217;d imagine; though what really bothered me about it was the design of the thing. Every character has the same build and appearance, and can pretty much only be told apart by their hair and clothing. The men all look like 12-year-olds with beards (watch especially for the creepy mayor and his smooth dance moves), and everyone&#8217;s got bizarro mouth shapes that match their dialogue almost as often as they match the characters&#8217; emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;Atlantis&#8221; plays out like a feature-length script that someone condensed into 22 minutes. It&#8217;s got no payoff, but it&#8217;s harmless fun with some neat characters and energetic voice acting. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth checking out, especially for kids who dig the sets.</p>
<p>Atlantis actually reminded me of a more successful version of &#8220;The Adventures of Clutch Powers&#8221;, particularly in the structure and characterization. &#8220;Old Guy, Meathead, Nerd, and The Girl all go off on an adventure where they use building skills to do&#8230; something.&#8221; <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_The_Adventures_of_Clutch_Powers/70130180?trkid=2361637">Clutch Powers is also on Netflix</a>, but I&#8217;ll have to save my extended thoughts on that yawn-fest for another time.</p>

<p>Last month I got to attend the world premiere of the new LEGO direct-to-video film, &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s a CG animated feature from TT Animation; an offshoot ofÂ <a href="http://www.ttgames.com/">Traveller&#8217;s Tales</a>, creators of the LEGO video games.</p>
<p>The &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; screening was held at <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/2013-spring-lego-batman-the-movie/">The Paley Center for Media</a> in Manhattan, and featured a panel of guests including voice actors Troy Baker (Batman), Travis Willingham (Superman), and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), as well as director/producer Jon Burton and director of photographyÂ Jeremy Pardon.</p>
<p>Yes, you still need a DP on a production with no real cameras.</p>
<p>When this film was first announced, I heard many LEGO fans cry foul; wondering, &#8220;are they just going to edit theÂ cut-scenesÂ from the LEGO Batman 2 video game together and call it a &#8216;film&#8217;?&#8221; You can all rest easy; &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is more than that. The TT Animation team has put together a solid film that ranks up there with TLG&#8217;s previous home video releases, even surpassing them in some cases (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-The-Adventures-Clutch-Powers/dp/B0030ZIZRC">Clutch Powers</a>).</p>
<p>Which is not to say it&#8217;s a perfect film. &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is TT Animation&#8217;s first venture intoÂ film-making,Â and there are some artifacts from that crossover. You might think I&#8217;m referring to the visuals &#8212; the entire film was made using TT&#8217;s game engine, making it essentially a feature-length machinima piece. But &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; was rendered as a film and not as a real-time video game, so there are noticeable improvements in lighting, staging, animation, and picture quality. The director also called out a few set pieces that had been upgraded to CG LEGO brick-built status, having been simpler CG backgrounds in the game.</p>
<p>(One detail I found particularly amusing was that the production team added dust and scratches to the character textures, to make them seem more like real LEGO minifigs. While we&#8217;re constantly <a href="http://youtu.be/TjH7Iy2VsaQ?t=2m50s">working at Paganomation toÂ remove imperfections</a> from real minifigs, the CG artists on this film spent time putting them in.)</p>
<p>In fact, it was actually the pacing of the film that felt the most like a video game. The story is entertaining and well-told, but it&#8217;s laid out in a strange, level-based way: action scene, story scene, action scene, story scene. This would work well in a video game, but it was a bit distracting at times to feel like I had to &#8220;complete&#8221; the action scenes in order to continue following the story. When the creators brought up the fact that they started working on this film <em>before</em> the LEGO Batman 2 video game, I was not terribly surprised.</p>
<p>Another thing that stuck out as a video game holdover was an unusual amount of violence in the film. Of course, it&#8217;s &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;, so it&#8217;s all very cartoony violence between super-powered heroes and villains, but it still struck me as odd. Nothing you&#8217;d need to shield your kids from, but kind of unnecessary at the same time.</p>
<p>All of this said, I really did enjoy &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;. It has a solid, funny, attention-keeping story, and some great voice acting. I think the voice actors were my favorite part of the film; probably helped in part by the Q&amp;A panel after the film (which also confirmed my belief thatÂ Clancy Brown is awesome).</p>

<p>The film had a nice balance between familiar voices, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Clancy Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Rob Paulsen</a>, and folks I&#8217;d never heard of, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684869/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Troy Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992184/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Travis Willingham</a> (although they both have super-long IMDb credits lists, so what do I know).</p>
<p>Stealing the show in the voice department, though, was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772116/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Charlie Schlatter</a> as Robin. The Robin subplot got a bit uncomfortable at times; he&#8217;s not treated very well by some of the characters. But his performance was really funny, and his story has a satisfying arc that has him holding his own with the other heroes by the end of the film.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d definitely recommend checking outÂ &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of the better entries in the LEGO home video pantheon &#8212; probably helped by the decades of development all of these DC characters have had. The Blu-ray/DVD drops May 21st, and you get a nifty Clark Kent minifigure with your purchase, so it&#8217;s win-win.</p>
