				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear readers: it is with heavy hearts that we have decided to close the Set Bump blog.<span id="more-2899"></span></p>
<p>Over the past few years, we haven’t been able to update or post things as much as we would have liked, and our discussions on the world of LEGO animation and brickfilms have moved almost entirely to our individual web and social media channels (e.g. <a href="http://www.paganomation.com">Paganomation</a> and <a href="http://www.brick101.com">BRICK 101</a>).</p>
<p>But before we take down the blog on DESTRUCTION DAY<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (May 16, 2018), we wanted to give you a chance to save any of your favorite links or articles from the site.</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading and contributing to The Set Bump!</p>
<p>&#8211; David Pagano and Dave Pickett</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello&#8230; what have we here? <span id="more-2882"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/97vJOgp3j5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>We still haven&#8217;t seen an official trailer for &#8220;<a href="www.imdb.com/title/tt3778644/">Solo: A Star Wars Story</a>&#8221; (and it&#8217;s possible <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/01/24/youll-get-a-solo-a-star-wars-story-trailer-when-disney-darn-well-feels-like-it/#4e51d4d84ea3">we never will</a>).</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can whet your appetite with &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97vJOgp3j5E">Lando&#8217;s Deal</a>&#8220;, a wonderful film starring everyone&#8217;s favorite smooth-talking space pirate. I&#8217;ve seen a number of live-action Star Wars fan films, but none of them seem to capture my interest and attention like this one did.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like here—strong cinematography, dynamic blocking and staging, solid sound and voice work, neat bits of animation, and an overabundance of in-camera effects and lighting (the telltale red-and-black <a href="http://www.brickstuff.com">Brickstuff</a> wire is a giveaway). And that&#8217;s basically all ignoring the fact that it&#8217;s a brickfilm; I&#8217;m not even sure that &#8216;the LEGO of it all&#8217; factored into my enjoyment.</p>
<p>Overall, it&#8217;s just a simple, fun film, and it feels like Star Wars—you can tell that director Adam Nies has a particular fondness for that old card player / gambler / scoundrel.</p>
<p>And of course, the easiest way to win <em>me</em> over is with a behind-the-scenes video.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s our 5-year blogiversary!<span id="more-2812"></span></p>
<p>To celebrate this momentous occasion, David Pagano and David Pickett sat down and had a conversation about their past, present, and future. Below is a lightly edited transcript. Enjoy!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> This month marks the five-year anniversary of The Set Bump! A lot has changed in those five years: in the world, in the LEGO community, in the brickfilming community, and in our lives. So I thought we could take some time to reflect on some of those things and talk about what it&#8217;s been like to be us (and not us) over the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>:</b> I have no idea what it&#8217;s like to be not us. [deadpan pause]</p>
<p>A blog post like this might be the most bare-minimum celebration that we could possibly do—not because of our excitement level, but because we both have other work on our plates. We are busy people. But yes, we started this blog five years ago&#8230; and that is very insane to me.</p>
<div id="attachment_2823" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2823 size-full" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/set_bump_sketches_03-animation_bug-1.gif" alt="Set Bump logo sketch" width="600" height="518" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Logo sketches by <a href="http://www.nelsart.com/">Nelson Diaz</a>.</p></div>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>: </b>You know, we&#8217;ve talked about this a few times in all the interviews and stuff we&#8217;ve done for “<a href="http://setbump.com/book">The LEGO Animation Book</a>”, but I think it&#8217;s worth reiterating a little bit of our history together and how it led to us starting The Set Bump: we met at <a href="http://brickworld.com/brickworld-chicago/">Brickworld Chicago</a> in 2008, and then really became friends the following year. That’s when we started collaborating on stuff like the LEGO animation workshop we ran at Brickworld, as well as Brickjournal issue 14, which I think only came out in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>:</b> Well, we were writing it for like six months prior to that, which would have been 2010. (<a href="http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=962">The digital version of that issue is still available.</a>)</p>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> After that issue was published, that&#8217;s when we really started having a serious conversation: “what if we expanded this content into something bigger?” And that became the earliest plan for <i>The LEGO Animation Book. </i></p>
<p>As we worked on that first book outline, we realized, “well, if we&#8217;re gonna make a book, we should probably start collaboratively writing together more.” So we started this blog as a way to do that, and to stay engaged with the LEGO animation fan community leading up to the release of the book. That was kind of the original idea behind The Set Bump.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>: </b>All of that sounds correct to me. I was actually I was thinking about Brickworld earlier today, because I was looking for some photos for a thing that I can&#8217;t talk about yet, haha. But I found a few old pictures from classes and screenings.</p>
<div id="attachment_2820" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2820 size-full" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug.png" alt="" width="1280" height="738" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug.png 1280w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug-300x173.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug-768x443.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug-1024x590.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BW_2010_Pagano_bug-700x404.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">David Pagano teaches an animation workshop at Brickworld Chicago 2010.</p></div>

<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b>  I am always in favor of digging up old, weird photos. You know, I feel like, to this day, there still isn&#8217;t a great blog about LEGO animation as a topic. The thing that keeps ours from greatness is the infrequency with which we post to it. I mean, <i>I </i>think our blog is the best blog about LEGO animation, but I&#8217;m also 200% biased.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>: </b>Sure. Another reason that the blog was a great idea was that it allowed us to not only start a fanbase in anticipation of the book, but to have that conversation on our terms as well. We’re always trying to stay involved with the the brickfilm community, but online forums are neither of our styles. I don&#8217;t know if that’s due to our ages, or just&#8230; I think we both have an affinity for things that are more like prose; things that are a little more academic as opposed to an endless thread of comments.</p>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> I mean, we&#8217;re both very verbose (as evidenced by how we&#8217;re speaking in multiple paragraphs here), but also, we both have an aversion to internet drama. In my experience, forums always attract more drama than blogs because they are more about personalities and interactions. We don&#8217;t need to get into the “<a href="http://setbump.com/2012/09/the-second-coming/">Great Schism of Brickfilms.com</a>” again in this post, but when that divide in the community happened, both of us only realized it like six months after the fact—because that was about how frequently we visited the forums. Suddenly, everyone was over at Bricks In Motion.</p>
<p>Which reminds me: one thing to point out, of course, is that when we launched our blog, it wasn&#8217;t called The Set Bump. It was called <a href="http://brickanimation.com">BrickAnimation.com</a>, and those URLs still work to this day.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>: </b>But the reason behind that was that our book was originally going to be called “The Brick Animation Handbook”, right?</p>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> Yeah, that was the working title. We spent a lot of time thinking through titles both for the blog and the book, and just thinking about brick animation in general.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>:</b> I tell this story often: I specifically remember the moment when we came up with the name for this blog. You were sitting at the table at my old studio, and I was laying on the carpet next to the television, and we were both just like&#8230; saying words back and forth to each other, trying to come up with ideas.</p>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> I know once we said “set bump”, both of us were like “oh!” Because we were literally brainstorming for 24 hours non-stop.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>: </b>And this was after <a href="http://setbump.com/2012/09/help-us-blog-readers-youre-our-only-hope/">we already held a contest to name our blog</a>, which didn’t give us a name we liked, but did give us a kind of jumping-off point. I&#8217;m scrolling through our naming document now&#8230; “Bricks, Flicks and Motion Pics” was one of the winners, which we ended up using as a tagline of sorts. Also, shout-out to “The Commanders of Blokammander”, which is just a wonderful phrase.</p>
<p><strong>PICKETT</strong><b>:</b> I really still want fanart of the two of us, in some sort of ‘80s sci-fi movie poster called “The Commanders of Blokammander”.</p>
<p><strong>PAGANO</strong><b>: </b>Love it. Get Kevin Hinkle on the phone.</p>
<p>I’m reading through the other ideas… <a href="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/setbump_nameideas-1.pdf">It’s a long document</a>, but you can see that it ends when “set bump” came up like three times with different modifiers. “The Unfortunate Set Bump”, “The Unwanted Set Bump”, “The Inevitable Set Bump”.</p>
<p>That’s when we were like, “what if it was just ‘The Set Bump’?”</p>

<p>The Set Bump, a blog about animation, blogged an animation about an animator experiencing a set bump while animating an animator experiencing a set bump while animating.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.comic-con.org/">San Diego Comic Con</a> was this past weekend, and it gave us a look at the second trailer for &#8220;The LEGO Ninjago Movie&#8221;. Putting aside the constant LEGO Movie &#8220;parental issues&#8221; plotlines, there are some solid gags in this preview—as well as a tease at how this film will integrate the live-action world, which is something that was almost completely lacking from &#8220;<a href="http://setbump.com/2017/06/lego-batman-movie-2017/">The LEGO Batman Movie</a>&#8220;.

<p>I feel obliged to blog it because there are still so few examples of human-scale brickfilms. However, watching this film mostly just made me want to rewatch &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBjLW5_dGAM">Western Spaghetti</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://setbump.com/2015/02/paint/">Paint</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>The most impressive parts (brick-built cracking an egg and pouring milk) go by so quickly they are hard to fully appreciate (thank goodness for the 0.25 speed setting on YouTube).</p>

<p>I&#8217;m curious what others think about this film. Did it feel fresh to you, or a little stale? (Bread puns intended)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because why not.<span id="more-2768"></span></p>
<p>The Golf Channel website has a couple of brick re-creations of moments from golf history; apparently created in anticipation of/to promote <a href="http://www.theopen.com">the 146th Open</a> which starts this week.</p>
<p>These don&#8217;t seem to be anything close to a cross-promotional tie in with The (all lower-case) lego Group, but they are officially branded with the rainbow peacock logo. (I&#8217;m picturing <a href="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-05/30/21/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web12/anigif_sub-buzz-20286-1464657595-2.gif">an NBC page</a> animating these in a spare office.)</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/media?guid=6ABC5534-2D17-ADE3-9C79-466096DD35D3">here&#8217;s minifigure Jack Nicklaus beating Doug Sanders at The Open in 1970.</a></p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="http://vplayer.golfchannel.com/p/BxmELC/gc_embedplayer/select/media/kXmVh5dfDLOM?&amp;ssid=nbcs_golfchannel_video_player" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.golfchannel.com/media?guid=E3794B7C-AAFA-1927-08F1-466096DD52EE">here&#8217;s Henrik Stenson&#8217;s win at Royal Troon—with one of the most unusual attempts at minifig lip-sync I&#8217;ve ever seen.</a></p>
<p><iframe style="border: 0; padding: 0; margin: 0;" src="http://vplayer.golfchannel.com/p/BxmELC/gc_embedplayer/select/media/6BQ5vt_FUDmf?&amp;ssid=nbcs_golfchannel_video_player#playerurl=http%3A//www.golfchannel.com/video/stenson-wins-open-lego/" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>As (nearly) always, the viral intent of these spots means that we get no credits and no attribution for the animators. The style here is perhaps a bit too simple to be able to recognize the animators by sight, but maybe some of you internet sleuths can figure out who was behind these.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 07/21/17:</strong> Thanks to <a href="http://setbump.com/author/silverspine/">my co-editor</a> and some <a href="http://setbump.com/author/thefourmonkeys/">smooth simians</a>, we now know that these spots were made by Jared Jacobs, aka Gold Yeller! Check out some more spots (as well as some behind-the-scenes) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goldyeller/">here</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s no wonder this delightful comedy won Best Film and Best Screenplay in the 2016 Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild Film Festival. I really like how the living room set gets reimagined for each of the different dimensions they visit. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This excellent brickfilm is a year old, but I was reminded of it after blogging &#8220;<a href="http://setbump.com/2017/07/the-eyes-have-it/">Sheep</a>&#8221; the other day. <span id="more-2746"></span></p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxUXuu73-T8">LEGO Arcade Robot Breakdance Battle</a>&#8221; is the stunning debut brickfilm by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMhYBiiD4NN1OlhFyVCO9mA">BreakBricks</a> (though not their first stop-motion animation). The animation, lighting, cinematography, and music are all outstanding. The use of replacement animation for the 1&#215;1 eye tiles make the characters really come to life with emotion. Some of those tiles were custom made for this animation, but I don&#8217;t think anyone can hold that against this charming film.</p>

<p>Maxime also goes the extra mile and makes all the sheep blink which not only adds life to the characters but helps hide some of the eye movements and replacements.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready to follow <a href="http://www.legobatman.com/">Batman</a>? And maybe learn a few life lessons along the way?<span id="more-2617"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ARp9KBtzP4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I was all set to write a review of &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie&#8221; way back in February, before the film even came out. The first of 2017&#8217;s two sequels to <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a> focused on not only a beloved character from the first film, but on one of <a href="http://fandomania.com/100-greatest-fictional-characters-1-batman/">the most popular fictional characters of all time</a>. Batman is a pop culture institution. So is LEGO. Combining them is a sure thing.</p>
<p>And for the most part, that&#8217;s accurate. The film did well; it&#8217;s got a <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_batman_movie/">90% score on Rotten Tomatoes</a>. The product line was robust and full of <a href="https://brickset.com/sets/theme-The-LEGO-Batman-Movie">beautifully designed sets</a> and characters. There was even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Batman-Movie-Making/dp/1465456619">a lovely Making-of book</a> for the film (though it&#8217;s really more a collection of concept art book than it is a comprehensive look behind-the-scenes).</p>
<p>So why did I find it so hard to write anything about this film? Why didn&#8217;t I have the same vigor I had while writing <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">my in-depth review of the first film</a>?</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s because a &#8220;LEGO Movie&#8221; is no longer the gamble it once was. This sequel was another fun, well-made film in the LEGO Movie universe, with a great cast and some wonderful designs. But unlike the original, the marketing for this film definitely had the vibe of &#8220;yeah, come on&#8230; we know you&#8217;re all gonna come see this.&#8221;</p>
<p>On top of that, the &#8220;Batman&#8221; of it all is nothing new, either. All of the familiar motifs are here:</p>
<ul>
<li>A gang of Gotham&#8217;s worst criminals (led by The Joker, natch) is loose in the city, wreaking havoc and conspiring against our heroes,</li>
<li>The Gotham City government and police force struggle with this excessive amount of crime. And, of course,</li>
<li>Millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne dresses like a bat man to clean up the town and work through the pain of losing his parents at a young age.</li>
</ul>
<p>On paper, this might sound like a recipe for a dull film. But as with the first <em>LEGO Movie, </em>what makes it all work is a wonderful dose of humor, self-awareness, and an obvious love for the property. <em>LEGO Batman</em> is definitely a fun watch, and if you liked the original, you&#8217;ll probably like this one, too.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this all means that I don&#8217;t much else to say about <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em> itself. Dave Pickett and I <a href="https://youtu.be/3ARp9KBtzP4">talked at length about it on my YouTube channel</a> back in February (see above), if you&#8217;re interested in some further random discussion.</p>
<p>However, I will say this: I am curious to see what comes next, given the fact that we&#8217;ll have &#8220;<a href="https://www.warnerbros.com/lego-ninjago-movie">The LEGO Ninjago Movie</a>&#8221; to watch and think through a few months from now. As far as IPs go, <em>Ninjago</em> is certainly no <em>Batman</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>You can catch <em>The LEGO Batman Movie </em>on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MUI1NPD?ref=dvm_us_tvod_sl_g_TtlM_59|c_201238940585_m_Sjvqe40l-dc_s__">DVD, Blu-ray,</a> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-lego-batman-movie/id1197505667">iTunes,</a> and elsewhere.</p>

<a href="http://setbump.com/2017/04/submit-to-the-2017-brickworld-film-festival/">As previously mentioned</a>, this is the first year that we opened it up to entrants from across the globe, and it showed—we received 34 eligible entries; a record number for our festival!</p>
<p>The winners were voted on by an audience of ~100 Brickworld registered attendees. Without further ado, here are the winning entries:</p>

<p>Vox and Grant Freckelton from Animal Logic do a great job explaining the difference between the <a href="http://setbump.com/2014/02/if-the-lego-movie-isnt-stop-motion-what-is-it/">stop-motionesque style</a> of <em>The LEGO Movie</em> and the &#8220;noodle limb&#8221; approach of the other LEGO CG movies. There are lots of great freeze frames from the movie that illustrate various points.</p>

<p>They also explore the influence of brickfilms (and <em>The Magic Portal</em> specifically) on <em>The LEGO Movie</em>. If you&#8217;re well versed in brickfilm history this is probably old news to you, but it&#8217;s all presented in a beautiful and easy-to-consume package. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Bump and the Knight&#8221; by 5-K Animations is less than 2 minutes long, but it establishes a spooky mood in the first two seconds.<span id="more-2638"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tc8TyCxDgM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The opening shot of a microscale castle on a lonely island during a lightning storm immediately sets the tone for what&#8217;s to follow. What really puts it over the top for me is the tilted angle of the camera. The sound, lighting, set design, and cinematography are all working in tandem to create an atmosphere of mystery and unease.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-1024x546.png" alt="" width="700" height="373" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2643" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-1024x546.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-768x409.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.31.46-PM-1-700x373.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The film is full of gorgeous shot compositions. It&#8217;s rare to see a brickfilm with such intimate and thoughtful camera placement.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-1024x543.png" alt="" width="700" height="371" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2650" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-1024x543.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-300x159.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-768x407.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.51.53-PM-1-700x371.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The repeated use of the tilted camera angle keeps viewers on edge right up to the final moments of the film.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-1024x547.png" alt="" width="700" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2645" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-1024x547.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-768x410.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.33.12-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>I also like the open-ending nature of the film. It feels very much like a classic LEGO commercial where it tells just enough of a story to hook the viewer, but let&#8217;s them decide how to continue the story when they <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/6034-1/Black-Monarch-s-Ghost">buy the toy</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-1024x547.png" alt="" width="700" height="374" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2648" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-1024x547.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-768x410.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-31-at-2.32.17-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Brickfinder/photos/a.199825736884791.1073741828.199822026885162/590580617809299/?type=3&#038;theater">Brickfinder</a> has found a set that harkens back to the <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Studios/page-1">LEGO Studios sets</a> from the early 2000s. <span id="more-2576"></span></p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2578" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker.jpg 960w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker-768x576.jpg 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker-268x200.jpg 268w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/movie_maker-700x525.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></p>
<p>Retailing for 35 Singapore dollars (roughly $25 USD), the set includes 152 pieces, most of which seem to be used to build a smartphone  camera mount. The camera mount looks like it can tilt using technic connections and do a dolly move by rotating at its attachment point (mixel ball joint) to the set. The set seems to include cardboard backdrops similar to the LEGO Studio sets.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lego_studio.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="497" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2580" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lego_studio.jpg 690w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/lego_studio-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" /></p>
<p>This set hasn&#8217;t been officially announced by LEGO, so we don&#8217;t have many details, but it&#8217;s safe to assume that LEGO will be offering some kind of stop motion app in conjunction with this set. Which would explain why they <a href="http://setbump.com/2017/01/lego-releases-poorly-timed-tips-for-brickfilming/">recently removed their two stop motion apps</a>. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see LEGO returning to this type of set after 15 years. We&#8217;ll have a full review of this set once it&#8217;s more widely available.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/bricksinmotion">‘Bricks in Motion’ documentary</a> will be available for download and streaming on Vimeo ‘On Demand’ starting this Friday, February 3rd at 12:00 PM ET.<span id="more-2544"></span></p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/152123247" width="640" height="320" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Philip Heinrich directed, edited, and produced the feature length documentary that “explores the lives of individuals involved in the hobby of creating stop-motion animated films with LEGO bricks and other building toys.” Fellow producers include Zach Macias, Doug Vandegrift Jr., and Nathan Wells. (Editor&#8217;s note: and our very own David Pagano!)</p>
<p>The documentary film was a crowd funded Kickstarter project backed by 270 funders. They raised $12,800 to help send the producers of the documentary around the world to interview brickfilmers. Most of those Kickstarter funders have had the opportunity to see the documentary, but the general public has not&#8230; until now. <a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/bricksinmotion">Pre-order is available for $8.99</a>!</p>
<p>The interviews were filmed in 17 cities on both sides of the Atlantic.  Interview filming consisted of 18 days in North America and 18 days in Europe. The film also has original animated segments along with dozens of pre-existing brickfilms. Producers Philip, Zach, and Nathan animated for three weeks “tirelessly together on a tight schedule to complete.”</p>
<p>Seán Willis is credited as assistant editor. His task was cataloging and organizing the interview content for Philip to edit. The editing process was extensive and many revisions were made. Different cuts were “shown to various producers and audiences in order to gauge pacing and clarity.” After about 4 months of editing, the film was completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bricks In Motion&#8221; runs 1 hour 27 minutes and has both English and French subtitles available. The filmmakers have also set up a <a href="https://www.thunderclap.it/projects/52607-bricks-in-motion-movie-release">Thunderclap campaign</a> to promote the film&#8217;s online release.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite as frustrating as getting trapped in the red tape of a bureaucracy. &#8220;Paragraph&#8221; by golego animation &#038; nichtgedreht illustrates that beautifully.<br />
<span id="more-2535"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drgCFNRIQFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Paragraph&#8221; is a great example of non-verbal communication, the story is told solely through creative visuals and a great soundtrack. One of my favorite moments is when the main character comes to a hallway of colored doors all of which are labeled with a different color. </p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-1024x548.png" alt="" width="700" height="375" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2537" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-1024x548.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-300x160.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-768x411.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.47.06-PM-700x374.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The cinematography adds to the feeling of an endless quest through a bureaucracy because it it all one continuos shot on a giant set. The final pull back to reveal all the people endlessly lost, is a fitting ending for a film about a confusing hopeless quest. It also recalls the amazing <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-lego-movie/">end title sequence</a> of &#8220;The LEGO Movie.&#8221;</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.48.24-PM-1024x552.png" alt="" width="700" height="377" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2538" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.48.24-PM-1024x552.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.48.24-PM-300x162.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.48.24-PM-768x414.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-26-at-2.48.24-PM-700x377.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What new things can we expect to see from our favorite minifig millionaire playboy?<br />
<span id="more-2497"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re a little less than one month out from the North American release of &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie&#8221;, the first of this year&#8217;s two (!) sequels to 2014&#8217;s &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;. In the time since <a href="http://setbump.com/2016/03/teasing-the-lego-batman-movie/">our last post about it</a>, there have been a number of trailers for the film, as well as a few TV spots with additional footage. Let&#8217;s review.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/aBJyp2LFHgk">Teaser Trailer #1 &#8211; The Batcave</a></h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aBJyp2LFHgk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The first teaser sees Batman introducing us to his Batcave, general solitude, and the overall concept of the film. It also features an opening prologue, which suggests (albeit jokingly) that the film was written and directed by Batman himself. I would love it if that conceit carried over to the actual film.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/LHgQSwgKygk">Teaser Trailer #2 &#8211; Wayne Manor</a></h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHgQSwgKygk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The second teaser followed only a few days later, and gave some insight into LEGO Batman&#8217;s parentage (spoiler alert: <a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/032/373/120345790360.jpg">Batman&#8217;s parents are dead</a>) as well as how this film fits into the overall Bat-continuity. The Wayne Manor fireplace room is a gorgeous design, and the animation of Batman flopping around the floor like some sort of fish is very entertaining and well-posed. #ABR</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/iMdQXYQ_MD8">Comic Con 2016 Trailer</a></h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMdQXYQ_MD8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The Comic Con trailer was the first to feature Michael Cera&#8217;s Dick Grayson/Robin, as well as more looks at the Batcave and Batman&#8217;s expansive costume collection.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/rGQUKzSDhrg">Trailer #4</a></h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rGQUKzSDhrg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The succinctly-titled &#8220;Trailer #4&#8221; serves as an amalgam of the previous previews, while also showcasing more of the plot and characters—including Rosario Dawson as Barbara Gordon, and Zack Galifianakis as The Joker.</p>
<h3><a href="https://youtu.be/djlsDykmZ_c">Extended TV Spot</a></h3>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/djlsDykmZ_c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, the Extended TV Spot confirms something that I was curious about—this film will take place in &#8220;Gotham City&#8221; (or a reasonable brick-built facsimile) and not Bricksburg (home of Emmet from the original LEGO Movie). We also get more of the Dark Knight&#8217;s rogues gallery, including The Riddler, Catwoman, Penguin, Gentleman Ghost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman_Ghost">(real)</a>, Calendar Man <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_Man">(very real)</a>, and the Condiment King <a href="http://batman.wikia.com/wiki/Condiment_King">(really really real)</a>. Of course, my favorite villain (seen here in a quick glimpse) will most likely prove to be Killer Croc, if only for the retro LEGO crocodile head he sports in this film.</p>
<p>What are you most looking forward to in <em>The LEGO Batman Movie</em>? Did we miss any of the trailers? Let us know in the comments!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, LEGO and PENTATONIX released a 360 video of the Christmas song &#8220;Up on The Housetop.&#8221; It&#8217;s a weird, immersive experience. <span id="more-2481"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T7f_RuGiahs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>360 videos present a unique challenge for the viewer. Do you just watch the default view and trust that most of the action will be there (a safe bet with this particular video)?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2482 size-large" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-1024x594.png" width="700" height="406" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-1024x594.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-300x174.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-768x445.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141653-e1482256843276-700x406.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Do you look around at random things that are potentially not very interesting (like the floor)?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2483" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-1024x574.png" alt="" width="700" height="392" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-1024x574.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-768x431.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141659-e1482256773800-700x392.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Do you watch multiple times looking at various angles trying to find hidden stuff and inadvertently get the song stuck in your head for several days? I know I did.</p>
<p><img src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-1024x570.png" alt="" width="700" height="390" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2485" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-1024x570.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-300x167.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-768x427.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot_20161215-141740-e1482257065544-700x389.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Ultimately, this video relies more on the gimmick of &#8220;Hey look, it&#8217;s PENTATONIX in LEGO form!&#8221; than the gimmick of &#8220;Hey look, you can spin this video around in different directions to see interesting stuff.&#8221; For an example of a 360 video using LEGO that actually rewards the viewer for looking around, check out this Simpsons / Ghostbusters crossover.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherhoodWorkshop">Brotherhood Workshop</a> created this animated version of the Today Show&#8217;s Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb for TLG&#8217;s &#8220;Shared Kindness&#8221; campaign involvement. <span id="more-2471"></span></p>

<p>There&#8217;s some nice stuff going on here, from the dogs playing fetch to the idling crowd outside the Today Show studio. It&#8217;s always interesting when TV personalities and celebrities get &#8220;LEGO-fied&#8221;; something I expect we&#8217;ll see a lot more in the coming year with &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie&#8221; and &#8220;The LEGO Ninjago Movie&#8221; on the horizon for 2017. (EDIT: <a href="http://setbump.com/2016/12/360-degrees-of-lego/">or right now.</a>)</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what this campaign was all about, but it seems like it&#8217;s <a href="http://nbcsharekindness.com/we-want-to-elevate-1-million-acts-of-kindness-and-heres-how-you-can-help/">an NBC News promotional drive</a>. Not quite a charity fundraiser, and not to be confused with <a href="http://www.kindnessshared.com">this non-profit</a>. I like the sentiment of it all, but it could be a bit clearer. Maybe it&#8217;s just because I don&#8217;t watch the Today Show.</p>
<p>(And of course, despite the YouTube description touting &#8220;the super creative folks behind LEGO&#8217;s legendary stop-motion animations&#8221;, there is no attribution to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherhoodWorkshop">Kevin Ulrich or his team</a>. For TLG, &#8220;Sharing Kindness&#8221; apparently does not include giving credit where credit is due.)</p>

<p>This whimsical piece came to my attention through a message from Thomas Panio, a student in a brickfilming class I taught way back in 2011. He and one of his classmates, Malibu Taetz, crafted this lovely &#8220;Fantasia&#8221;-like film (which was one of the finalists in <a href="https://cinebrick.wordpress.com/finalistas-2015/">Cine Brick 2015</a>).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to like in this four-part short; from the well-timed brick-and-plate abstractions in the opening to the lush greenery of the later narrative segments. I also noticed some clever workaround techniques—using a cape to hide disconnect minifigure limbs is a pretty effective solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just wanted to let you know that I still make brickfilms and your class definitely helped me make better films,&#8221; Thomas says. I am very proud.</p>

The trailer recreation was so awesome that even Popular Mechanics wrote a <a href="//www.popularmechanics.com/technology/a20756/lego-geniuses-have-animated-the-rogue-one-trailer/" target="_blank">blog post about the video</a>. Gareth Edwards (the actual director of Rogue One) also wrote to the animators, commending them on their LEGO Rogue One trailer.</p>

<p>Warner Bros. has released some promotional images for its forthcoming, aptly-titled film: &#8220;The LEGO Batman Movie.&#8221; (Not to be confused with <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/03/lego-batman-the-movie/">&#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie&#8221;</a>, a home video release from 2012.)

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have praised Jon Rolph (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG-xwlDpX_96O4ggWH8JmPQ">CheesyBricks</a>) before for his <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/04/addicted-to-egg/">concision</a>. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLAqDKIkgsg">latest animation</a> contains even fewer frames than that 17-second gem.<span id="more-2295"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SLAqDKIkgsg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Horse in Motion&#8221; is a mere 15 frames, but oh what a 15 frames they are! Jon Rolph has recreated in LEGO <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/eadweard-muybridge-animal-locomotion-plate-626">one of the most famous image sequences ever</a>. To do so, he used an unusual technique; rather than connecting a bunch of pieces together, he simply arranged unconnected pieces on a flat surface.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this technique before in MOCs (such as this <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/xenomurphy/8313941921/in/album-72157640572166663/">Spider-Man mosaic</a>), but I can&#8217;t think of anytime I&#8217;ve seen this in a brickfilm. The closest parallels I can think of are Annette Jung&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/09/annette-jung-strikes-again/">Thriller</a>&#8221; and the Mr. DNA scene in &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/2015/04/spared-no-expense/">LEGO Jurassic Park</a>&#8221; by Paul and Hailee Hollingsworth. </p>
<p>I recommend watching &#8220;Horse in Motion&#8221; in high-resolution on a large screen in slow motion. It&#8217;s a lot of fun to look at the unexpected LEGO element Jon sprinkled into the different frames (e.g. a chicken, a hand truck, and a pirate flag).</p>

<p>The student has become the teacher.<span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret (or is it?) that I love teaching; there&#8217;s something fun and special about sharing what you&#8217;ve learned with other people. Over the past few years, Dave and I have done just that—leading numerous workshops on LEGO Animation (we even went so far as to compile <a href="http://twomorrows.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=98_78&amp;products_id=962">a BrickJournal issue</a> about it).</p>
<p>Whenever we discuss storytelling in our classes, I caution folks against things like making a film &#8220;about the person who couldn’t come up with an idea for their film,&#8221; on the basis that &#8220;it’s been done to death.&#8221; Now, without even knowing it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Harrison Allen</a> has proved me wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZZL0bHG-vk">Ella&#8217;s Tale</a>&#8221; is charming and well-made, and is wholly worth your time in spite of being based around one of the more overused film school tropes. It was an entry into the recent BRAWL 2015 contest over at <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/21285/brawl-2015/">BricksInMotion.com</a>—meaning that it all came together in one week. Plus, it&#8217;s got a hidden ninja.</p>
<p>Just goes to show: <em>any</em> idea can become a memorable film in the hands of the right creator. I hope you learned your lesson, past-David.</p>

<p>Ok, &#8220;we&#8221; didn&#8217;t build it, but it <em>was</em> built by someone.<span id="more-2281"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got some catching up to do here, so let&#8217;s start by drawing your eye to this &#8220;LEGO City&#8221; promo made for LEGO China a few months back. Directed by Rogier Wieland, &#8220;LEGO_Adventure in the City&#8221; is a fantastic mix of traditional miniatures, really impressive brick-built replacement animation (check out that dino!), and goofy minifig business. The live-action bits are a treat as well; all of the disparate media meshes well together into a fun story that perfectly captures a post-&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221; brickfilm world.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s even a sweet behind-the-scenes video <a href="https://vimeo.com/127632215">here</a>! Good stuff.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;BrickFlix Lite&#8221; screening will be part of <a href="http://brickmagic.org/">BrickMagic 2015</a>, in Concord, North Carolina. The bad news? The screening won&#8217;t be in a movie theater, as it has been in past years. The good news? The restrictions on films with licensed characters are relaxed, so you can finally submit those epic fan films you&#8217;ve been sitting on.

<p>It may be a bit too quiet here lately, but nothing stops the brickfilming community from pressing onward with impressively cool stuff. (We&#8217;re working on some cool stuff of our own, I promise.)<span id="more-2254"></span></p>
<p>This Jurassic Park tribute was helmed by the father-daughter team of Paul and Hailee Hollingsworth, aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCedQsT16AP8tUwtR9cTqFjg">Digital Wizards</a>. They (along with folks like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/filmyguy1">Sean Willets</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">Forrest Whaley</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BaratiProductions">Garrett Barati</a>) spent several months on the piece, re-creating some of the most memorable scenes from the classic 1993 film. My favorite bit is the stop-motion inclusion of Mr. DNA. Gotta love brick-built animation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a point of pride for the community as a whole when brickfilms get high-profile attention, and this one certainly made the rounds—being featured on <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/03/29/395815259/a-father-daughter-team-remakes-jurassic-park-in-lego-form">NPR</a>, <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/24/jurassic-park-lego-recreation/">Mashable</a>, <a href="http://entertainthis.usatoday.com/2015/03/26/dad-and-daughter-recreated-iconic-jurassic-park-scenes-lego/">USA Today</a>, and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="yt" style="color: #222222;">As a brickfilmer, I get asked lots of questions about how I make my brickfilms. There are also people who ask for advice on how they should start. So, I was very happy to see that Kevin Ulrich of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherhoodWorkshop">Brotherhood Workshop</a> answered those questions (and more) in these two videos.</p>
<p><span id="more-2170"></span></p>
<p class="yt" style="color: #222222;">Kevin has been making brickfilms for 10 years now, which explains why he is so good. It&#8217;s been only three years for me, so I still have time to improve. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> I hope you learn some tricks, and find as much motivation in Kevin&#8217;s words as I did. (Pay close attention at the &#8220;good enough&#8221; part.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qhbliUq0_r4&amp;feature=youtu.be" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qhbliUq0_r4&amp;feature=youtu.be" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" /></object></p>
<p>A <a href="http://youtu.be/qhbliUq0_r4">&#8220;Save the Arctic&#8221; campaign video</a> from Greenpeace has been making the rounds, <a href="http://legoblockshell.org">calling on The LEGO Group to end its partnership</a> with multinational oil and gas company Shell.<span id="more-2142"></span></p>
<p>The video features a vast arctic landscape, where humans and wildlife are swallowed up by a gigantic amount of oil released by a brick-built Shell oil rig. The piece ends with a caption that reads &#8220;Shell is polluting our kids&#8217; imaginations&#8221;, and the whole affair is underscored by a haunting cover of <a href="http://youtu.be/StTqXEQ2l-Y">&#8220;Everything is Awesome&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, this campaign is brilliant. Between <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">The LEGO Movie</a>, <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/05/beyond-the-brick-a-lego-brickumentary-2014/">the &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; documentary</a>, and the usual promo releases from TLG, 2014 has squarely solidified LEGO video content into the zeitgeist. This production plays right into that &#8212; not only through the music, but with some well-designed builds, artfully composed shots, and sweeping camera work. (For the moment, let&#8217;s ignore the blatant inclusion of a <del>Mega Bloks</del> <a href="http://www.brickforge.com/">Brickforge</a> Halo figure, and <a href="http://citizenbrick.myshopify.com/collections/minifigs/products/dragon-sword-fighter-force-complete-series-plus-bonus-minifig">GoT-looking figs that may or may not be the ones from Citizen Brick</a>.)</p>
<p>As clean as the cinematography is, though, the actual message of the video feels a bit more muddled. I understand what the goal is: Greenpeace wants to convince LEGO to end its partnership with Shell. That&#8217;s the &#8220;what&#8221;. But the &#8220;why&#8221; of it all seems less clear; at least as far as this video and <a href="http://legoblockshell.org">the associated website</a> are concerned.</p>
<p>When I first heard about this online movement <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/greenpeace-lego-shell-partnership-toys-oil-arctic">a week ago</a>, my initial reaction was <em>&#8220;does TLG even still </em>make<em> Shell-branded sets?&#8221;</em> Apparently, the answer is yes. Here&#8217;s a bit of history on TLG&#8217;s partnership with Shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell-branded LEGO sets appeared <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/325-3/Shell-service-station">as early as 1966</a>.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Shell">Brickipedia</a> (which could really use some better attribution), the majority of the Shell sets were not available in the US. It seems as though Shell-branded LEGO products only started appearing stateside in 1986.</li>
<li>Prior to 1986, TLG also released<a href="http://brickset.com/sets?query=Exxon"> a few Exxon-branded sets</a> in the US.</li>
<li>In 1992, <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/6594-1/Gas-Transit">Octan</a> began to replace Shell as the main (albeit fictional) gasoline brand of LEGO Town (and later, City) sets.</li>
<li>1999 saw the last of the <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Town/subtheme-Shell">official wide-release sets with Shell branding from TLG</a>.</li>
<li>The Shell logo continued to be prevalent in LEGO kits until <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/year-2012?query=ferrari">as recently as 2012</a>, due to <a href="http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/oils-lubricants/cars/shell-oils/shell-ferrari.html">the partnership between Shell and Ferrari</a>.</li>
<li>Additionally, <a href="http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/fuels/ferrari-model-lego-collection.html">LEGO products continue to be offered as exclusives at Shell stations</a> to this day, though they are not always available in all regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, none of this information is included in <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/html/STA_SW2014/index.html">the Greenpeace &#8220;Save the Arctic&#8221; website</a>. Nor is there much information about what Shell is doing, or documented evidence as to how the environment is being affected. And for what little content there actually is on the site, there&#8217;s basically no attribution or sources. (Although some digging did turn up <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/sites/files/gpuk/Lego%20Is%20keeping%20Bad%20Company.pdf">this PDF</a> that goes into a bit more detail.)</p>
<p>What we get instead as the main hub of this campaign is a weird, heavy-handed, confusing-to-navigate site that <span style="color: #222222;">approaches <a href="http://legoclick.com/">&#8220;LEGO CL!CK&#8221;</a> levels of poor web design. Selecting the &#8220;more information&#8221; button on the site continues the mixed messages: should readers be concerned about advertising&#8217;s influence on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo">the children</a>, saving the Arctic, preventing global warming, or Shell&#8217;s use of licensing partners to distract from its other corporate ventures? It feels like Greenpeace wants folks to simultaneously think about all and none of these things, and instead get so riled up in a ball of knee-jerk emotion that they sign the petition without a second thought. </span></p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;d rather do some research and make well-informed decisions. Is Shell involved in some unsavory business practices?<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/04/shell-oil-safety-warnings-moved-drill-ship-us-coast-guard"> Seems like it.</a> Does a partnership with Shell fly in the face of<a href="http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/sustainability"> TLG&#8217;s commitment to environmental responsibility</a>? Maybe. Should a petitioning crusade eschew sourced information and individual judgment in favor of reactionary tactics to make its voice heard? Probably not.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a footnote: My research here is by no means exhaustive. If you&#8217;ve got thoughts or facts to contribute, or articles to reference, feel free to post them in the comments below. This campaign has already seen coverage in <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/greenpeace-lambasts-lego-polluting-childrens-imaginations-shell-sponsorship-1455749">the International Business Times</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryflynn/2014/07/08/everything-is-not-awesome-with-lego-and-shell-says-greenpeace/">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/greenpeace-takes-on-lego-over-shell-partnership-1.2695167">CBC News</a>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time<a href="http://youtu.be/CtQKcM48hnw"> LEGO video content has been utilized in the service of activism</a>, and I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 7/11/14:</strong> Looks like the video was pulled from YouTube due to a copyright claim from Warner Bros.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 7/14/14: </strong>The video is back up on YouTube, and currently has 4.2 million views.</p>

<p>Something is happening in outer space&#8230;<span id="more-2132"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/6135">Peter Reid&#8217;s Exo Suit</a> is the latest release from the website-formerly-known-as-Cuusoo, <a href="https://ideas.lego.com/">LEGO Ideas</a>. To announce the impending arrival of this set, TLG put out the above CG animated video, &#8220;co-created&#8221; (whatever <em>that</em> means) by Chris Salt of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/0ldScratch">Oblong Pictures</a>. I think having promotional videos for upcoming LEGO Ideas sets is a great concept on TLG&#8217;s part, but as with so many of their releases, this one suffers from being about twice as long as it needed to be.</p>
<p>Oddly, I don&#8217;t think the running time would have stuck out to me as much if the video had been done with stop-motion. As much as I&#8217;d love to see the real Exo Suit kit get animated (and I&#8217;m sure we will), it is a fragile-looking design. TLG tends to use CG when there are clear advantages to having a weightless wire-frame model, and that makes sense here from a production standpoint.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; none of those advantages are really utilized, and there&#8217;s large swaths of time where we&#8217;re basically looking at a video of a still image. It&#8217;s neat that the characters adhere to real-world minifig limitations (the influence of The LEGO Movie continues to be felt), but there is just SO MUCH DEAD TIME in this piece that it makes me wonder why they bothered making an animated video at all. When Exo Suit pilot Yve punches the keypad at 2:00, and the door starts whirring open with all the quickness of an inebriated turtle, I literally yelled at my computer screen for it to hurry up.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can certainly appreciate the effort that goes into making an animated video of any kind; this one just didn&#8217;t do it for me. Despite the less than stellar (space pun) execution, I&#8217;m hoping that promo videos for LEGO Ideas sets become something we see more of in the future. At the very least, it did get me excited about the set itself.</p>

<p>2014 is shaping up to be a great year for LEGO fans, and for fans of LEGO motion pictures in particular. April 20th saw the world premiere of <a href="http://thelegodocumentary.com/">&#8220;Beyond the Brick: A LEGO Brickumentary&#8221;</a> at <a href="http://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/53208b8ac07f5df7d2000a25-beyond-the-brick-a-lego-b">the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.</a></p>
<p>Not to be confused with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/beyondthebricktv">the podcast of the same name</a>, or <a href="http://vimeo.com/9581676">the previously released short-form LEGO documentaries</a>, &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; is a charming, playful look inside the worldwide LEGO fan community. Despite being moderately involved with the film (insofar as I was interviewed for it), I found the film&#8217;s content quite surprising; going in, I was expecting a more storied history of TLG as a whole. In fact, the film turned out to be more focused on AFOLs and other folks who take this children&#8217;s toy and do interesting, creative stuff with it.</p>
<p>Among those highlighted in the film are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/88574960@N02/">Alice Finch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/65402716@N07/">Stephen Pakbaz</a></li>
<li><a href="http://brickartist.com/">Nathan Sawaya</a></li>
<li><a href="http://robinhoodautismfoundation.wordpress.com/lego%C2%AE-therapy/">Dr. Daniel LeGoff</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.janvormann.com/testbild/dispatchwork/">Jan Vormann</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.math.ku.dk/~eilers/lego.html">Søren Eilers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1543728341/melting-point-a-stop-motion-short-film">Jonathan Vaughan</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.paganomation.com">Me</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The film&#8217;s proceedings are led by a stop-motion minifig narrator, voiced by Jason Bateman. He serves to introduce each segment, as well as bridging some gaps between events, locations, and people. Having a narrator like this in the film was paramount &#8212; the LEGO fan community is widespread and varied, and &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; makes the bold attempt to cover as many facets as possible within its 95 minute running time.</p>
<p>The animation for the film was done by Tommy Williamson (aka <a href="http://bricknerd.com/">BrickNerd</a>) and James Morr (aka <a href="http://www.youtube.com/spastikchuwawa">Spastik Chuwawa</a>), with some help from Kevin Ulrich (of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherhoodWorkshop">Brotherhood Workshop</a>). I also noticed a few other familiar names in the credits, including <a href="http://www.brickfun.net">Marc-André Caron</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>. I assume that a number of the animated clips probably came from the <a href="http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/BottomMenu/Blog/08012013-show-us-an-afol-competition.aspx">ReBrick &#8220;Show us an AFOL&#8221; competition</a>. Unfortunately, the less-than-stellar ReBrick archival approach makes it difficult to find any specific information about which entries won the contest and were included in the film. (If your entry was included in the film, please let us know in the comments below.)</p>
<p>In addition to being featured in &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; (the documentary), I was also a guest this past week on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVzxyuRmiLQ">&#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; (the podcast)</a> to discuss &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; (the documentary).</p>
<p>&#8230;Yeah. For those interested, I go a bit more into detail about my thoughts on the film, as well as a little bit of behind-the-scenes info:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DVzxyuRmiLQ" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, if you have the opportunity, I highly recommend checking out &#8220;Beyond the Brick: A LEGO Brickumentary&#8221;. The next stop for the film is the <a href="http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/beyond-the-brick">Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF)</a>, where the film will be playing on:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/beyond-the-brick">Friday, May 16 @ 4:00pm – Lincoln Square Cinema, Bellevue</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/beyond-the-brick">Saturday, May 17 @ 3:30pm – SIFF Cinema Uptown Theater, Seattle</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.siff.net/festival-2014/beyond-the-brick">Sunday, May 18 @ 2:30pm – SIFF Cinema Uptown Theater, Seattle</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After that, we&#8217;re not sure where the film will go next, but as soon as we know, you will, too!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just how much of &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221; is stop-motion?<span id="more-1989"></span></p>
<p>As of this writing, the most-viewed article on The Set Bump is <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/06/no-the-lego-movie-isnt-stop-motion/">this short-and-admittedly-more-snarky-than-helpful piece entitled &#8220;No, &#8216;The LEGO Movie&#8217; isn&#8217;t stop-motion&#8221;</a>. I posted this commentary last year, as a response to several articles that jumped the gun by describing the contents of <em>The LEGO Movie</em> trailer as stop-motion when it was clearly done with CG.</p>
<p>Now, when I say:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was clearly done with CG.</p></blockquote>
<p>I of course mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on my 20+ years of study; and my knowledge of the limitations of LEGO stop-motion, film scheduling, and cash money; I (and my well-trained eye) can say with 99.9% certainty that not one shot in &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221; trailer is pure stop-motion photography.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, motion pictures are illusions by definition, but I was still confident in my assertion that <em>The LEGO Movie</em> wasn&#8217;t stop-motion. Further adding to the confusion were <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/">contradictory</a> <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/07/more-details-about-the-lego-movie-from-comic-con/">comments</a> from the directors and filmmaking crew, which skirted the line between actual information and marketing hype soundbites. What we really needed was hard evidence in the form of behind-the-scenes featurettes and footage.</p>
<p>And over the past month or so, we got just that.</p>
<p>First up was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH4tMSd3QJY">this &#8220;Behind the Bricks&#8221; mockumentary featurette</a>, which was basically just a promo piece and not anything about the making of <em>The LEGO Movie </em>itself. Funny, but not helpful. It all still looked like 100% CG.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cH4tMSd3QJY" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Next was this weird footage dump from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ScreenSlam">ScreenSlam</a> of some <em>LEGO Movie</em> making-of clips. Still no sign of stop-motion. (They did release <a href="http://youtu.be/QukCJA253rs">some fun behind-the-scenes bits of the dialogue recording session with Chris Pratt</a>, though.)</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xP3LP4Bt-NA" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Then came this (veeeeeery dry) <a href="http://www.fxguide.com/fxguidetv/fxguidetv-186-the-lego-movie/">episode</a> and <a href="http://www.fxguide.com/featured/brick-by-brick-how-animal-logic-crafted-the-lego-movie/">article</a> from fxguide, featuring interviews with Animal Logic crew members who detail (greaaaaaat detail) the CG approach and pipeline used for <em>The LEGO Movie. </em>Vindication was mine!</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/kaIjnJ6A65A" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, earlier today, <a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-lego-movie/">Art of the Title gave us a look at the creation of the end titles from</a> <em>The LEGO Movie</em>, and &#8212; lo and behold &#8212; they actually are stop-motion. Annoyingly, I can&#8217;t embed the videos here, but you should definitely check out the link. There&#8217;s a ton of cool making-of goodness to pour over.</p>
<div id="attachment_1991" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-lego-movie/"><img class=" wp-image-1991 " alt="Screenshot 2014-02-25 23.36.35" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-2014-02-25-23.36.35-1024x576.png" width="630" height="354" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-2014-02-25-23.36.35-1024x576.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-2014-02-25-23.36.35-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screenshot-2014-02-25-23.36.35-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the set of the full end title reveal.</p></div>
<p>So what does this all mean? Well, it means that <em>technically </em>the directors weren&#8217;t kidding when they said there was some stop-motion in the film. Although it does still feel a tiny bit disingenuous to describe the <em>entire</em> film as &#8220;part-CGI and part actual real LEGO bricks in stop-motion&#8221;.</p>
<p>To be honest, having seen <em>The LEGO Movie</em> for a third time this past week, I still wasn&#8217;t sure myself as to whether the end titles were stop-motion or not. The animation and physical built pieces looked like stop-motion, but the structure of the &#8220;cubbyhole&#8221; layout seemed too CG-like to me. Knowing now how much CG pre-vis was done on the sequence, that assertion makes total sense.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess the most important thing to take away here is that it really doesn&#8217;t matter what medium is used to make a film; as long as the story is compelling, memorable, and filled with characters who invite you to join them on their journey. Of course, I&#8217;ll still be waiting with bated breath for <em>The LEGO Movie </em>on home video&#8230; despite being CG, there are some amazing builds that I really want to go through one frame at a time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be checking the DVD featurettes veeeeery carefully for any signs of stop-motion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sports brickfilms are a unique genre of brickfilms.  Most have no story, aside from <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/olympic-lego-then-and-now/">recreating an actual sporting moment</a>, no characters other than famous athletes with personalities, and little to no dialogue. <span id="more-1954"></span>The genre of sporting brickfilms has some popularity and the dozen on this list have over 14 million views. Many find their popularity from the brickfilming community, the general YouTube audience, the online sporting community, or just being in blogged by the countless online news groups.</p>
<p>I researched a bit today on the ole&#8217; internet for some examples of sporting brickfilms and I found ten videos plus two of our own creations that we made recently.  So&#8230;&#8230;I present &#8220;A Dozen Sports Brickfilms&#8221; in order based of the current number views.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GYgf7R1M5u4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYgf7R1M5u4">Seattle Seahawks Win OYO Super Bowl XLVIII!</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefourmonkeys4">thefourmonkeys</a> was released on the Sports Illustrated Kids <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sikidsdotcom">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">website</a>.  It recreates the most recent Super Bowl with OYO Sportstoys minifigures.  It&#8217;s the newest of the dozen brickfilms.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/G91fjqRoHsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G91fjqRoHsQ">LEGO Snowboarding Tricks &#8211; Brickfilm (HD)</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FilmsByDan">Plastic Planet Productions</a> is a beautiful take on snowboarding done brick style.  It has very smooth animations and is quite a fun watch.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zCjL5Vr5Q5s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCjL5Vr5Q5s">The Red Sox World Series Victory, in OYOs!</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefourmonkeys4">thefourmonkeys</a> was also released on the Sports Illustrated Kids <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sikidsdotcom">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">website</a>.  It was released just shortly after the completion of the 2013 World Series and enjoyed a small viral affect due to the blogging and tweeting about it. Of the 1/2 dozen sports brickfilms that thefourmonkeys made for SIKids, this one is the most popular. The sporting fans loved the beard tug and helmet adjustment.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oiHWtHAjX7E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiHWtHAjX7E">Lego Freeskiing: Deep Pow</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Googl295">Oxburger</a> Studios.  I found this film for the first time today. Wow!! The cinematography, lighting, and scenic elements draw you into this awesome snow skiing adventure.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fv0kkgmPQgo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0kkgmPQgo">Lego Sport Champions: Hockey</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a> The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a> channel looks pretty dormant these days, but they left us with some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports/videos">great sports brickfilms</a>. Although the equipment they used to make their films is fairly antiquated, their brickfilms stand the test of time and are well worth the watch.  They also used no minifigures which makes them special just for that fact.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/v8Ln9hkXPlc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Ln9hkXPlc">Lego Sport Champions: F1 Racing</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a> This F1 car race is a super exciting thrill ride at high speeds.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/TuA_PUZV7pc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuA_PUZV7pc">Champions League Final 2013 in LEGO (Borussia Dortmund v Bayern München)</a> by <a title="Weevil888" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Weevil888">Weevil888</a>.  Pure football (soccer) excitement.  The stop motion is not incredibly smooth, but the use of the original announcer audio pulls you into an exciting brickfilm.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-Jm3JhG-JtU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jm3JhG-JtU">5 Greatest NBA Finals Moments Legoized</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tauntrtv">tauntrtv</a> recreates plays from basketball championship games.  It&#8217;s a well produced video with decent stopmotion that has me remembering the old NBA days. I&#8217;m not a big fan of basketball, but you don&#8217;t have to be in order to enjoy this. Ahhhh, the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1cJ-D13tnaM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cJ-D13tnaM">Lego Skater</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Keshen8">Keshen8</a> brings brickfilming and skateboard half-pipes to amazing reality, with a little exception to the overly gory spill the hapless skateboard takes.  OUCH!</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zMvbfLxtMaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMvbfLxtMaA">Bricksports.de: NFL Super Bowl XLV</a> by <a href="http://www.bricksports.de/">Bricksports.de</a>.  Bricksports.de recreates Super Bowl XLV in LEGO.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLMBZa3fSg">Brick by Brick: Running: Usain Bolt wins gold in 100m final</a> by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian">Guardian</a>.  The video was produced by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">Guardian</a> (an online news group) and they have also released a dozen or so brickfilm sports recreations. The animation is a little choppy, but the sets are really good and you get a great feel for the energy of the events recreated.  I really liked the water in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYUFNUWY-2U">Michael Phelps video</a>.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/EOvEhWfneUM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOvEhWfneUM">Lego Mini Golf</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MlCHAELHlCKOXFilms">MlCHAEL HlCKOX Films</a> is the king of sporting brickfims according to views.  It currently has over 12 million views and is one of the most popular brickfilms on YouTube.</p>
<p>If you know some more great sporting brickfilms, leave a comment with a link.  We would love to watch them. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In preparation for seeing the LEGO Movie last night (spoiler: I really enjoyed it), I&#8217;ve been reading a lot of reviews/previews of the movie and wanted to share some of the most insightful tidbits I&#8217;ve come across.<br />
<span id="more-1937"></span><br />
My illustrious Co-Editor has already written an excellent (though spoilery) <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">review</a>, I won&#8217;t add anything except to once more encourage you to <strong>go see The LEGO Movie</strong>. Once you&#8217;ve done that, come back here for even more coverage dissecting it piece by piece.</p>
<p>One of the few reviews I&#8217;ve seen that actually focuses on the animation style of the film is <a href="http://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/lets-talk-about-the-animation-in-the-lego-movie-95781.html">this one over at Cartoon Brew</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many films have attempted to break the Pixar-by-way-of-Disney animation mold by suggesting a more stylized approach to animated movement, among them the Madagascar series, Wreck-It Ralph, and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. Lego Movie pushes further than any of those films with a consistently inventive style of movement (the key word being consistent).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://io9.com/the-makers-of-the-lego-movie-take-apart-their-creation-1516662564">This feature on io9</a> has some interesting quotes from the directors. Chris McKay, who was in charge of the animation, has nice things to say about brick films:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a charm to those brick films. I think part of that comes with the heart and soul of the filmmaker who comes to the table and wants to create something that is probably beyond their scope&#8230; We wanted the movie to feel like that.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=271142095&#038;ft=1&#038;f=">This NPR review</a> reveals a scene that got nixed:</p>
<blockquote><p>They initially penned a re-education scene for Emmet, with his eyes forcibly held open, after he strays too far from Lord Business&#8217; way of doing things. The Stanley Kubrick reference was deemed &#8220;not perfectly appropriate for family audiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(Don&#8217;t worry, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/paganomation/little-guysin-space-a-lego-fan-film-from-paganomat/posts/675959">someone else</a> has got a LEGO version in of that in the works&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.avclub.com/review/the-lego-movie-is-another-lovable-effort-from-the--201056">The AV Club review</a> (contains the spoiler) nicely mirrored my own sentiments and Mr Pagano&#8217;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only real bone to pick with The Lego Movie is that the gender disparity of the toys themselves—a pervasive criticism of the brand—has carried over to the film’s major characters&#8230; Wyldstyle, though confident and talented, often exists to play the foil of Batman and Emmet. And the only other major female character, voiced by Alison Brie, isn’t portrayed as a mini-figure, making Wyldstyle the catchall female protagonist.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-the-lego-movie-1201082797/">The Variety review</a> helpfully points out how many bricks it would take to build all the stuff shown in the movie:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if someone had orchestrated the entire experience with plastic toys painstakingly repositioned and photographed one frame at a time&#8230; that would have taken no fewer than 15,080,330 bricks</p></blockquote>
<p>This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xP3LP4Bt-NA">behind-the-scenes video</a> is a random collection of footage, but it does shed some light on the animation process: </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xP3LP4Bt-NA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Lest you think all the reviews of the LEGO Movie are effusively positive (<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lego_movie/">though most are</a>), there are some naysayers with some valid points. <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/the-lego-movie-review-will-ferrell-batman">This bit from the Wrap</a> is what resonated with me the most:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while the film’s underlying message about creative independence and playfulness is a strong one, the movie takes a third-act turn (which won’t be spoiled here) that’s bold but ultimately wrong-headed, restating what we’ve already figured out and ruining the delicate balance of this movie’s goofy, click-and-snap universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have more to say on that last bit, but I&#8217;m going to wait a couple days before writing about all my concerns with the movie&#8217;s big twist.</p>
<p>Which reviews have helped you in digesting the LEGO Movie?</p>

<p>What makes a LEGO movie a &#8220;LEGO Movie&#8221;?<span id="more-1931"></span></p>
<p>In response to the release of &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xxxfancypantsxxx/">Fancy Pants</a> put together this assortment of clips from 15 popular brickfilms. It&#8217;s a great showcase of some of the best the medium has to offer (we&#8217;ve covered a few of the selections <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/11/lovecraftian-pastiche/">here</a> <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/09/insomniac-is-right/">before</a>), but something about the sentiment behind it seems off.</p>
<p>Here at The Set Bump, we can certainly be somewhat <a href="http://youtu.be/7HNd3qz68Zw?t=58s">snooty</a> in terms of what makes something &#8220;true&#8221; LEGO animation. On the other hand, as I said <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">in my spoilertastic review</a>: <em>The LEGO Movie</em> is, for all intents and purposes, a brickfilm in the truest sense of the word.</p>
<p>What do you guys think? Are there definite criteria for what makes a &#8220;real&#8221; LEGO movie? If so, do you think <em>The LEGO Movie</em> qualifies?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We can all breathe easy &#8212; <a href="http://www.thelegomovie.com/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a> is actually pretty cool.<span id="more-1870"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1912" alt="emmetawesome" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/emmetawesome.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Here at The Set Bump, we&#8217;ve been keeping tabs on the progress and development of <em>The LEGO Movie</em> for a while, <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/">compiling what morsels of information we could</a> to try and satisfy our curiosity. The announcement of the film <a href="http://variety.com/2009/film/news/warner-builds-pic-with-lego-1118007162/">(waaay back in 2009)</a> left many unanswered questions in our minds &#8212; what would a LEGO motion picture even be about? Would it be <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/06/no-the-lego-movie-isnt-stop-motion/">done in stop-motion?</a> Could it possibly be <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/01/the-adventures-of-clutch-powers-2010/">as boring as <em>Clutch Powers?</em></a></p>
<p>Fear not, dear readers, for we now have answers and so much more. Sound <a href="http://youtu.be/edL_kNErIuw">the spoiler alarm</a> <strong>(I&#8217;m about to spoil pretty much everything)</strong>, and let&#8217;s dive on in.</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p><em>The LEGO Movie</em> tells the story of Emmet Brickowski, a construction worker minifig who lives his average life in the average LEGO city of Bricksburg. Using very familiar-looking instruction booklets, Emmet helps build skyscrapers for the Octan Corporation, under CEO President Business.</p>
<p>But President Business has a secret alter-ego: Lord Business, a tyrannical despot with designs to conquer the entire LEGO universe by &#8212; what else? &#8212; gluing everything together.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a group of minifig Master Builders (i.e. our main cast and some licensed supporting cameos) has found the key to foiling Lord Business&#8217; plan: the fabled &#8220;Piece of Resistance&#8221;. Unfortunately, that piece just happens to be glued to Emmet&#8217;s back. And thus, the odyssey begins&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1911" alt="thepiece" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/thepiece.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a larger story at work in <em>The LEGO Movie,</em> too (both figuratively and literally), but I&#8217;ll get to that.</p>
<h3>Characters</h3>
<p>Emmet (Chris Pratt) is the focal character of the film. Pratt plays the LEGO everyman to a T &#8212; his mastery of goofy charm (refined <a href="http://youtu.be/PeLCx-CXmgM">in his role as Andy Dwyer on &#8220;Parks &amp; Recreation&#8221;</a>) makes him a perfect fit to carry a LEGO film.</p>
<p>Emmet&#8217;s a simple fellow, but his eagerness and sincerity make his adventure a joy to watch. And in the standard &#8220;hero&#8217;s journey&#8221; manner, he picks up a variety of allies along the way&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) is the wise old sage and inveterate foe of Lord Business. Having failed to protect the LEGO universe in the past, Vitruvius foretells of a prophesied chosen one &#8212; &#8220;The Special&#8221; &#8212; who will unlock the key to Lord Business&#8217; eventual defeat.</li>
<li>Wyldstyle, aka Lucy (Elizabeth Banks) is an ambitious and headstrong Master Builder, who&#8217;s actively trying to become The Special by finding the Piece of Resistance. You may remember my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Paganomation/posts/10151541676733201?stream_ref=10">considerable</a> <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/10/preview-the-preview-of-the-lego-movie/">dislike</a> for the name &#8220;Wyldstyle&#8221;; fortunately, it turns out the movie agrees with me (via lots of &#8220;what are you, a DJ?&#8221; jokes at her expense). For better or worse, a lot of Wyldstyle&#8217;s character centers around a sort-of love triangle (a &#8220;like triangle&#8221;?) between her, Emmet, and her current boyfriend&#8230;</li>
<li>Batman (Will Arnett) is the Dark Knight as a hilarious parody; as if the Christopher Nolan films featured Adam West-inspired dramatics. Arnett is perfect in this role, and although much of his funniest material is in the trailer, there is one great sequence where millionaire playboy Bruce Wayne becomes integral to the plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other helpful side-characters include Benny, a 1980s-era LEGO spaceman who REALLY wants to build spaceships; Unikitty, an anime-esque cat/unicorn hybrid with some serious anger issues (and some terrific brick-built alternate faces); and Metalbeard, a giant cyborg pirate who holds Lord Business responsible for his half-minifig, half robot condition.</p>
<p>In the villains&#8217; corner, there&#8217;s really only President/Lord Business (Will Ferrell); his underutilized right hand man, Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson); and an endless supply of robot police, robot feds, robot swat teams, and robot skeletons as cannon fodder for our heroes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1910" alt="robo" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robo.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>And then, there&#8217;s &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design of <em>The LEGO Movie </em>is where things really shine; it&#8217;s an amazingly gorgeous film. Every single setting has beautiful detailing and tons of NPU, almost to the point where it becomes distracting. There are dozens of visual nods to LEGO fandom, builder inside jokes, and some great micro-scale gags. Dave pointed some of these out in <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">his review of the trailer</a>, but that&#8217;s really only a small fraction of the insane beauty the filmmakers have packed in. That ocean! (I can&#8217;t wait to pause and frame-by-frame my way through the Blu-ray.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1909" alt="bricksburg" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/bricksburg.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>For those of you who were worried about the use of computer graphics over stop-motion, I can honestly say that the film does not suffer one bit for it. The framing of many of the shots, as well as the overall texturing and lighting of scenes, really gives you that tactile feeling of being immersed in a brick-built LEGO world. There are one or two shots where the scope of what you&#8217;re looking at belies the film&#8217;s tiny toy-scale nature, but these are few and far between.</p>
<p>In many ways, the design of <em>The LEGO Movie </em>feels like not only a celebration of LEGO products and the hobby as a whole, but also of the craft of animation. Every major animation technique is at work here:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stop-motiony quality to the cinematography and character movement really helps set this film apart from things like <em>Clutch Powers</em> and the other CG releases. It&#8217;s super fun, and it <em>feels</em> like LEGO. I&#8217;m sure this approach will inform many stop-motion brickfilms in the future, and I would also have no problem with it becoming the new paradigm for CG LEGO animation. (Please and thank you.)</li>
<li>There&#8217;s also some fantastically fluid 2D facial animation on all of the characters. The CG artists went so far as to give depth to the &#8220;paint&#8221; of the character face designs, as if the faces had been printed on like real LEGO minifigs. As someone who&#8217;s spent hours and hours staring at minifig heads through a macro lens, I truly appreciate this consummate attention to detail.</li>
<li>And then, finally, the CG polish and shine brings everything together.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a fourth filmmaking medium in the film as well &#8212; live-action photography. This was another detail made public by the filmmakers early on, though no one really knew what the implementation of it would be. As it turns out, the live-action sections are where the real story of the film lives.</p>
<h3>Themes</h3>
<p>In a broad sense, <em>The LEGO Movie </em>is built around a few overall motifs:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>L</span>EGO creations are not meant to be glued together, but to be continuously rebuilt into whatever cool models a creator can imagine.</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t have to build the greatest creation ever, as long as you&#8217;re building together with the people you care about.</li>
<li>Embrace the things that make you unique.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are the main themes as depicted in Emmet&#8217;s character arc; though, as we find out, Emmet is not really the main character of this story.</p>
<p>About 2/3 of the way through the movie, Emmet sacrifices himself by tumbling out of Lord Business&#8217; tower and down into a swirling vortex. Having blacked out, Emmet wakes up to find that he&#8217;s a toy LEGO minifigure in the human world, being played with by a young boy named Finn.</p>
<p>As the live-action scenes unfold, we come to understand that the events of the film up to this point have basically been a dramatization of Finn&#8217;s LEGO playtime scenarios. This makes sense as, earlier in the film, Emmet has a vision of &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;, as illustrated by his mental construction of a distinctly humanoid hand. Additionally, Lord Business&#8217; collection of non-LEGO human-scale artifacts (erasers, band-aids, highlighters, etc.) tells us that the LEGO universe must be somehow tied to our world.</p>
<p>Finn, however, is not &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221;. In a further twist (one which I found really enjoyable), it turns out that &#8220;The Man Upstairs&#8221; is actually Finn&#8217;s father, the real owner of the tables full of LEGO displays that make up the worlds of the LEGO universe. Finn&#8217;s father is quite unhappy, as those LEGO displays are part of his very adult hobby, and are NOT meant to be played with by Finn. When you consider the fact that Finn&#8217;s father &#8212; a businessman in a suit and tie &#8212; is also played by Will Ferrell, the central conflict and meaning of the story becomes unmistakably straightforward. Lord Business&#8217; super-tall legs aren&#8217;t just for show.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1915" alt="LordBusiness" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LordBusiness-1024x421.jpg" width="630" height="258" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LordBusiness-1024x421.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LordBusiness-300x123.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LordBusiness-700x288.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>(I&#8217;ve heard some comments from fans who question this portion of the film; saying that it&#8217;s a little insulting to AFOLs to be portrayed in such a way. Personally, I thought it was really funny.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s at this point that <em>The LEGO Movie </em>becomes not only a action movie for kids, or a toy advertisement, but a fable about the relationship between AFOL and KFOL, parent and child. The film is fundamentally a feature-length <a href="http://www.buildtogether.com/media/videos/#/media/video/3">&#8220;Build Together&#8221; spot</a> &#8212; a series of LEGO TV ads that, perhaps coincidentally, began right around the time this film was announced.</p>
<h3>A Few Gripes</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve already mentioned the somewhat distracting and complex artistry of the LEGO universe itself. The story, by contrast, is rather simplistic. To be fair, the way that story plays out doesn&#8217;t have a lot of padding or unnecessary scenes &#8212; everything is aptly cut &#8212; but it does feel slightly too fast-paced at times.</p>
<p>Which is crazy, considering the film runs for about 100 minutes in total. (Maybe I&#8217;m just getting old.) Plus, the notion that the entire tale comes from the imagination of a young boy really helps to lampshade a lot of the less satisfying story elements.</p>
<p>Another thing that made me a bit uneasy was the idea of &#8220;The Special&#8221;. I&#8217;m all for empowering kids to use their imaginations, but the word &#8220;special&#8221; is immensely overused in our cultural consciousness. As a concept, it just made me think of that line from &#8220;The Incredibles&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>When everyone&#8217;s super&#8230; no one will be.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, given that the intent here is to embrace those things that make us individually special (and the fact that the prophecy is all but thrown out as malarkey in the third act), I&#8217;m willing to give The Special a pass, too.</p>
<p>The only thing in <em>The LEGO Movie </em>that I couldn&#8217;t find any rationalization for was the utter dearth of female characters. Seriously. Where are all the women?</p>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve got Wyldstyle as the the only lady character with any real agency, though her role is not much more than that of <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionGirlfriend">Action Girlfriend</a>.</li>
<li>Unikitty (Alison Brie) is female, but is technically an animal and not a minifigure. Plus, she doesn&#8217;t come into the film until around halfway through, and even then, her presence is not terribly significant.</li>
<li>Wonder Woman is on the poster, and they went through the trouble of casting Cobie Smulders in the role, but the only thing she does in the film was already shown in the trailer. I honestly can&#8217;t remember if she had more than one line of dialogue in the whole film. (<strong>EDIT 2/16/14:</strong> She speaks literally eight words in the entire film.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask me, an easy solution would have been to cast a woman in the role of Vitruvius. There&#8217;s honestly not much you would have had to change about the character. It&#8217;s great that we now have a recording of Morgan Freeman saying the words &#8220;Taco Tuesday&#8221;, but I would have gladly given that up to have this film pass the Bechdel test. Wyldstyle is essentially Vitruvius&#8217; apprentice, and it could have been interesting to have a female-female relationship stand in contrast to the live-action father-son relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1914" alt="wyldstyle-vitruvius" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wyldstyle-vitruvius.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Given the recent furor over LEGO Friends, and the fact that a lot of the film&#8217;s tie-in sets include female minifigures, I expected a lot more from <em>The LEGO Movie</em> in that regard. (<strong>EDIT:</strong> I feel like <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2014/01/">this girl</a> might agree with me.) I think I might have cheered aloud when, towards the end, Will Ferrell tells his son that he&#8217;s going to have to let his sister play, too.</p>
<p>(Hilarious Duplo payoff notwithstanding, I don&#8217;t think it would have been too much to ask to actually see the sister on screen, though, even if just for a second. You can&#8217;t be what you can&#8217;t see.)</p>
<h3>Putting it all together</h3>
<p>One of the inside jokes of the LEGO fan community is that of the &#8220;Rainbow Warrior,&#8221; a name fondly given to <a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/lego-what_it_is_is_beautiful.jpg">those weird-looking multi-colored models we all built as children</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, <em>The LEGO Movie</em> is a bit of a Rainbow Warrior itself. For one thing, it ably tackles the unique problem of tying all the disparate LEGO worlds together; presenting the various play themes as parallel dimensions (and eschewing the nonsensical &#8220;play themes as planets&#8221; approach that <em>Clutch Powers</em> attempted to put forth).</p>
<p>But more than that, it manages to capture the fun, ubiquitous crossover vibe of every child&#8217;s playroom. Batman shooting his grappling hook at the Millennium Falcon in order to steal some spaceship parts from Han Solo and Lando Calrissian? That scene definitely happened in my backyard when I was a kid &#8212; and it happened in this movie, too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1916" alt="batmangrapple" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-1024x428.jpg" width="630" height="263" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-1024x428.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-300x125.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple-700x293.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/batmangrapple.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>Similarly, I couldn&#8217;t help but react to every pop culture reference and film allusion &#8212;</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminator (&#8220;Come with me if you want to not die&#8221;)</li>
<li>The Matrix (Real/dream world analogies, The One, and the &#8220;Think Tank&#8221; room)</li>
<li>Total Recall (The &#8220;Think Tank&#8221; again)</li>
<li>Robocop (&#8220;Where are my pants?&#8221; is this film&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;d buy that for a dollar&#8221;)</li>
<li>Super Mario Brothers: The Movie (Random dancing as a way to disable enemy forces, &#8220;cause everybody loves to dance, that&#8217;s why.&#8221;)</li>
<li>Star Trek (&#8220;The Kragle&#8221; might as well be &#8220;<a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/V'Ger">V&#8217;Ger</a>&#8220;)</li>
<li>Clash of the Titans (&#8220;Release the Kragle!&#8221;)</li>
<li>They Live (The subtle &#8220;Conform!&#8221; propaganda posters, and a few of the skeletal robot feds)</li>
<li>Hot Rod (I kept waiting for Batman to do <a href="http://youtu.be/onU6PGIoeo4?t=7s">this</a> towards the end)</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s not even including the official LEGO licenses. In a normal film, such an overabundance of seemingly random references might have felt lazy or unwarranted; but here, they somehow felt justified. I&#8217;ve already referenced &#8220;The Hero&#8217;s Journey&#8221; in this review, and maybe that&#8217;s all too appropriate &#8212; the minifigure might be the most literal encapsulation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a> ever.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>If I haven&#8217;t made it clear already, I thought <em>The LEGO Movie </em>was really fun, well-made, and an absolute delight to watch. The stunning visuals alone make it worth the price of admission, but the story is efficiently told and has some legitimate stakes, too. It&#8217;s not a perfect film, but as far as I&#8217;m concerned, there&#8217;s something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>Those of us who do LEGO stop-motion (myself included) can admittedly be a bit snobby when it comes to the relationship between CG and &#8220;true&#8221; Brick Animation. When discussing brickfilms in interviews and at workshops, I tend to describe them thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brickfilms are a way for LEGO fans to tell their stories through the use of film and animation techniques. They can use any style, and can be about anything, but they all have one thing in common &#8212; the use of LEGO bricks and elements!</p></blockquote>
<p>If that&#8217;s true, then I think it&#8217;s fair to say that <em>The LEGO Movie </em>qualifies as a brickfilm. Given the nature of the film&#8217;s story &#8212; a child whose imagined LEGO worlds are directly translated into on-screen action &#8212; <em>The LEGO Movie</em> might be the most ambitious, high-concept brickfilm ever. A meta-brickfilm, perhaps.</p>
<p>At the same time,<em> The LEGO Movie</em> also feels like a love letter to the entire brickfilming community. The directors have <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/01/its-official-we-inspired-the-lego-movie/">stated these intentions in interviews</a>, but there was one other fun touch I noticed in the film&#8217;s live-action sequence: the aforementioned swirling vortex that Emmet tumbles down is, in the human world, an over-sized kaleidoscope with the words &#8220;Magic Portal&#8221; written on the side. Kind of reminds me of <a href="http://www.rakrent.com/mp/">another Magic Portal</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not so important. What IS important is that this film is going to get a lot of people building. And animating. Heck, I left the theater and immediately went to the LEGO store to pick up one of the sets.</p>
<p>Go see <em>The LEGO Movie</em>.</p>

<p>This is the kind of video that reminds me why I make animations with LEGO bricks: because it&#8217;s fun! The camera movement adds a great momentum to the visuals that matches the momentum of the song and the paper backdrops are a lot more appealing than the monochromatic LEGO walls (or baseplates) that often appear in the background of amateur brickfilms.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping we&#8217;ll see more from Tasha R!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the U.S. opening of &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221; just two weeks away, I thought it would be a good time to revisit the &#8220;other&#8221; LEGO movie from a few years ago.<span id="more-1771"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1834" alt="LEGOteam" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/LEGOteam-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587414/">The Adventures of Clutch Powers</a>&#8221; is like so many LEGO CG releases &#8212; a lumbering mass of basic tropes, non-jokes, and now-retired LEGO products (none of which feature the actual main characters of this film). In essence, nothing more than one giant commercial.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s how I remembered it. I hadn&#8217;t seen the film since it was released direct-to-DVD in 2010, after which I immediately retired it to my bookcase for some dust-collecting action. Four years later, <a title="Analyzing the new LEGO Movie trailer" href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">the trailers for The LEGO Movie</a> seem to imply a similar storyline and vibe<em>, </em>so I though I&#8217;d take a second look at <em>Clutch Powers.</em></p>
<p>(Spoiler alert: my memory did not fail me.)</p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>The story of <em>Clutch Powers </em>somehow manages to be extremely simplistic and extremely confusing at the same time. Clutch, our main character, is &#8220;the greatest LEGO explorer ever&#8221; (think a blander Indiana Jones/James Bond) and works for LEGO &#8212; which, in this film, is not a toy company but an interplanetary organization that does, um, <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Peg: &#8220;Well&#8230; it&#8217;s about helping others!&#8221;<br />
Brick: &#8220;Fighting the good fight!&#8221;<br />
Bernie: &#8220;Engineering better solutions!&#8221;<br />
Clutch: &#8220;Doing whatever it takes, wherever it takes us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Delightfully vague.</p>
<p>After a throwaway cold open, the LEGO Organization sends Clutch and his team to investigate an incident on a space-prison planet. Finding that the <del>most dangerous</del> only three inmates have escaped, the LEGO crew then heads to a Castle&#8230; planet&#8230; to capture a wizard who had been one of those prisoners. There, Clutch attempts to instill confidence in a young prince, while also learning to work together with the members of his own team, so that they can all stop the wizard from doing&#8230; <em>something. </em></p>
<p>If it seems like I&#8217;m having trouble summarizing what happens in this film, it&#8217;s because I genuinely am. The whole thing plays out like an &#8220;And then&#8230;&#8221; screenplay written by a 6-year-old &#8212; not in a good way, like <a href="http://axecop.com/">Axe Cop</a>, but just the type of scenario a child might come up with while playing with some assorted LEGO kits. &#8220;And then MALLOCK THE WIZARD escapes from SPACE PRISON and they have to go to the CASTLE PLANET OF ASHLAR to catch him before he gets the GOLDEN SWORD OF KING REVET and takes over the whole world etc.&#8221; Insert spaceship swooshing noises here.</p>
<p>At the same time, the thinness of the plot is undermined further by some pretty obvious plot holes and contradictions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the LEGO Organization gets a distress call from the prison planet, the video footage shows Space Police officers who literally exclaim, &#8220;the prisoners are escaping!&#8221; Clutch and his team then proceed to wonder what happened&#8230; &#8220;it&#8217;s a bit of a mystery!&#8221; It&#8217;s really not; the prisoners escaped.</li>
<li>The team arrives at the prison, where the Space Police watch commander says that the escaped prisoners can&#8217;t leave the planet, since he removed key parts from all the Space Police vehicles. That being the case, the prisoners end up stealing Clutch&#8217;s ship. It seems as though the LEGO team is stranded, since all the other Space Police ships are disabled. Except&#8230; they&#8217;re not stranded, since the watch commander could literally just replace the parts (which we see him carrying) and all of the ships would work.</li>
<li>On the Castle planet of Ashlar, the Troll in charge of guarding the kingdom has built a giant wall to hide the castle so that Mallock (the wizard) can&#8217;t find it. I&#8217;m not sure why the Troll would need to do this, since Mallock has been locked up in space-jail for years, up until like an hour ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.62em;">Characters</span></p>
<p>Clutch&#8217;s big character trait is that he always works alone; a habit he adopted after the loss of his father (Rock Powers, natch) a few years earlier. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6AsY2hqgO0">He even has a song about it.</a></p>
<p>At the start of the film, Clutch is put in charge of a team for the first time; and yet, none of the other team members are surprised to be partnered <em>with him</em>, even though EVERYONE knows Clutch (and the fact that he works alone) since he is also THE MOST FAMOUS PERSON IN THE LEGO UNIVERSE FOR REASONS WE&#8217;RE NEVER TOLD. Clutch&#8217;s arc seems like it should be that he learns to work with his team, which is sort of what happens &#8212; though out of narrative convenience, rather than character interaction and development. At a certain point, it&#8217;s as if they all just randomly decided, &#8220;ok, let&#8217;s work together now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking of the team, I should probably introduce them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brick Masterson is a Fireman, Weapons Specialist, and Demolitions Expert. He&#8217;s the muscle of the group, and kind of looks like <a href="http://nbcparksandrec.tumblr.com/image/73511503766">Ron Swanson.</a> Brick tends to destroy more things than he actually builds; the best weapon he makes is a glorified battering ram.</li>
<li>Peg Mooring is a Biologist and a woman (FYI, this film does not pass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test">the Bechdel test</a> in any way, shape, or form). She uses her biology know-how to recognize footprints and tame a dragon off-screen. She also has extra hair that she brings with her, because girl. There are no other named female characters in this film, although we do catch a glimpse of a few extras from the <a href="http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10193-1">Medieval Market Village</a> who say nothing and do nothing.</li>
<li>Bernie von Beam is an Engineer who does wacky things and wears a gear on his head for a significant portion of the film. He has an accent.</li>

<p>The teams&#8217; terrestrial backup includes Kjeld Playwell (hah), head of the LEGO Organziation, and his in-house scientist Artie Fol (hah), who also does wacky things and is Clutch&#8217;s biggest fan (we know this because he tells us).</p>
<p>On Ashlar, there are some skeleton flunkies (one of whom is <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/">Chris Hardwick</a>), a good-guy Troll who loves Monty Python references, and Prince Varen, heir to the planetary throne. Mallock the Malign is the main villain of the film, even though some other evil guy named &#8220;Omega&#8221; gets name-dropped and then immediately forgotten.</p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>The design of the film is pretty bare-bones. Like many of the LEGO video games, the locations and vehicles that are not official LEGO sets are rendered as generically textured 3D backdrops; lots of grass, trees, rocks, cement, and solid colors.</p>
<div id="attachment_1833" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png"><img class=" wp-image-1833 " alt="CHECK OUT THOSE GRAPHICS" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/graphics-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">CHECK OUT THOSE GRAPHICS</p></div>
<p>There are a few things here and there that appear to have had actual thought put into them &#8212; Mallock&#8217;s stronghold comes to mind &#8212; but most of these are designed as a kind of weird kludge between brick-built and CG creations.</p>
<p>For the most part, though, the brick-built sets shown are actual LEGO products that were available in the time leading up to this film&#8217;s release. The same thing goes for the majority of the characters &#8212; the skeletons, the Troll, and Mallock (who was merely <a href="http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7093-1">an &#8216;evil wizard&#8217; in the 2007 Castle line</a>) all appeared in official LEGO kits, as did the Space Police officers and all of the extras.</p>
<p>Ironically, none of the main cast were ever created as minifigures. In fact, <strong>Clutch himself cannot even be built out of existing parts</strong>, as his torso and pants have custom printing, and <a href="http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=43753">his hairpiece has never been made in black</a>. Peg and Bernie&#8217;s wigs have never been made, either, and all of the faces are custom.</p>
<p>So, if you were a kid who watched this movie and wanted to build and play with the characters: not only could you not buy them in stores, you couldn&#8217;t even make them out of parts from your own collection. Even LEGO Universe <a href="http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Miscellaneous&amp;query=lego%20universe">wasn&#8217;t that bad</a>.</p>
<p>If there were such a thing as un-synergy, I think this would be it.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>The animation is fine; nothing to write home about. There&#8217;s some wonky mouth shapes and one or two floaty walks, but in general, the animation is effective and does the job it needs to do.</p>
<h3>Acting</h3>
<p>The voice acting in this film is decent, but it&#8217;s brought down by the poor writing and terribly stock dialogue. The biggest names involved are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McPartlin">Ryan McPartlin</a> (as Clutch) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Strahovski">Yvonne Strahovski</a> (as Peg), both of whom are from the TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(TV_series)"><em>Chuck</em></a>. I&#8217;m not sure how they got involved with this film, since the target audience doesn&#8217;t exactly overlap. Maybe someone in casting was like &#8220;<em>Chuck</em> is about a secret agent. Clutch is kind of a secret agent. Let&#8217;s get some of those actors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even stranger is the fact that, on <em>Chuck,</em> Ryan McPartlin&#8217;s character is not a secret agent or an explorer, or even a main character. He&#8217;s got a deep man voice with a nice sound to it, but it felt kind of wrong for the character of Clutch, who doesn&#8217;t really behave like a grown adult.</p>
<p>Again, part of that might be the writing. It&#8217;s obvious that the filmmakers wanted Clutch to be a cool Indiana Jones/James Bond type, but the way he&#8217;s written feels both immature and amateur. While watching the film, I wondered why they didn&#8217;t have the guy playing Prince Varen voice Clutch instead. Their story arcs are basically parallel, and even though the movie keeps TELLING us Clutch is famous and amazing, he feels just as young and inexperienced as the prince.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, <em>Clutch Powers</em> isn&#8217;t an offensive disaster, but it somehow manages to capture that rare combination of complexity and boredom. It unsuccessfully tries to be a movie by hitting those beats that other movies hit, and ultimately fails to be memorable, charming, or fun.</p>
<p>I did not laugh once.</p>
<p>Clutch himself is neither engaging nor lovable, and actually comes off as kind of a jerk for a significant portion of the movie. We never see or hear about any of his other missions, and most of what we do know about Clutch is merely what other characters tell us about him &#8212; even if that information contradicts the things we see him do on screen.</p>
<div id="attachment_1836" style="width: 692px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png"><img class=" wp-image-1836 " alt="&quot;I'm ambiguously mad at my father. It's his fault for going missing under suspicious circumstances!&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png" width="682" height="384" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers.png 853w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers-300x168.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/rockpowers-700x393.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;I&#8217;m ambiguously mad at my father. It&#8217;s his fault for going missing under suspicious circumstances!&#8221;</p></div>
<p>The script is weak, and the majority of the dialogue has no subtext. When the characters aren&#8217;t spewing tired clichés (&#8220;Lock and load &#8212; we&#8217;re going in&#8221;), they&#8217;re either saying exactly how they feel or just giving mindless exposition. There are one or two attempts to tie in some LEGOish values (&#8220;We build on each other!&#8221;, &#8220;Time to get creative!&#8221;), but these are few and far between, and feel like an afterthought.</p>
<p>One of the strangest recurring subjects is the notion of a &#8220;creation spark&#8221;. This is apparently the equivalent of a minifigure soul, although nothing about it is ever explored or explained. In a practical sense, it seems to be a way for the writers to talk about characters being killed or dying without having to say &#8220;killed or dying&#8221;. But in a storytelling sense, I find it baffling &#8212; are these characters alive or not? Is the creation spark a physical thing? Are minifigures kind of like <a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Spark">Transformers</a>? We&#8217;re never told.</p>
<p>Other plot lines that lead nowhere include the fate of Clutch&#8217;s father, and the identities of the two other escaped prisoners. This film is very obviously trying to be the first part of a franchise, but in doing so, it fails to tell a coherent stand-alone story.</p>
<p>As with LEGO toys, I want the LEGO videos and movies that I watch to be of the highest quality; the kind of material I can return to and enjoy no matter how old I am. TLG&#8217;s target market of 5-to-12-year-olds may hold water in terms of toy sales, but there&#8217;s no denying the universal timelessness of LEGO products. A big deal is made of the fact that bricks and elements from the &#8217;70s, &#8217;80s, and so forth will all fit together with parts from modern sets. LEGO cinematic releases should follow the same long-range principle &#8212; films with something for everyone.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the case with <em>Clutch Powers,</em> which is just a plodding, meaningless exercise where we see some sets that you could have bought in 2010, and then it&#8217;s over. I bring up the irony of &#8220;<a href="http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/lego-group/the_lego_history/1930">Only The Best Is Good Enough</a>&#8221; far too often when talking about LEGO home video releases, but TLG has set the bar really high for themselves with that motto, and as far as I&#8217;m concerned, has yet to reach it.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed for The LEGO Movie.</p>
<h3>Where to watch this film</h3>
<p>If you really must see this film, it&#8217;s available to <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_The_Adventures_of_Clutch_Powers/70130180">stream on Netflix for free</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Clutch-Ryan-McPartlin/dp/B003363I3O/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390505461&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=clutch+powers">rent it on Amazon for $2.99</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Clutch-Ryan-McPartlin/dp/B0030ZIZRC/">buy the DVD for three bucks more</a>. But I really don&#8217;t recommend spending any money on this.</p>

<p>Can a live action short film be a &#8220;brickfilm&#8221; too?  <span id="more-1813"></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/andrewmfilms">AndrewMFilms</a> must think so. His new film called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fk5F5NMaCQ">LEGO Invasion!</a> mixes live action and CGI brickfiming together for a wild ride that is a mix between the LEGO Movie, Aliens, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and Pulp Fiction.  Okay, maybe the last one is a stretch. The short film does showcase real plastic LEGO bricks which are used as the protagonist&#8217;s weapons.  All of the brick animating is CGI which is layered over the live action sequences quite seamlessly.  It is a really fun watch, unless you don&#8217;t seeing like your favorite super heroes getting blasted to bits by the protagonist.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The eleventh <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/18221/thac-11-starts-now-closed/">Twenty four Hour Animation Contest</a> (or THAC11) is now behind us. This is the second year <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp-gjmrxnNc">I participated (Battle of Smallville)</a> and, while waiting for the results, I want to share with you some of the best entries.</p>
<p><span id="more-1773"></span></p>
<p>This year&#8217;s theme was &#8220;A Mistaken Identity.&#8221; You know, when you see someone and think they are someone else. In THAC, the theme can be interpreted however the participants like (and they did so in very creative ways).</p>
<p>If you like to play the game, you can try to spot the mod element. In every frame of the movie, there must be a red brick connected to a grey brick or the there must be the letter T visible in any way (printed, built, or anything creative that looks like a T). That is a way to make sure the participants produced their brickfilms within the 24 hour time frame of the contest.</p>
<p>It would take you over 2 hours to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXr7QhekOKzovhLaYXqQboHU6QEAE_3cR">all 76 brickfilms</a> made for THAC11, but I picked out the best ones for you. Just for the fun of it, here’s my favorites in categories I just made up.</p>
<h2><b>Best overall performance</b><b></b></h2>
<h3><b>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQeWXkxMAY">The Does</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Cocotatam">A&amp;M Studios</a></b></h3>
<p>&#8220;The Does&#8221; takes us into a classic family sitcom with a nice setup and good animation. As the director says… well, you’ll see. I only want to point out that it is a very good use of different minifig&#8217;s heads.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/RrQeWXkxMAY?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rpG7d6UBSo">Con</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Disney365Stitch">AquaMorph Productions</a></h3>
<p>Based on a good narration, the animation is well done and really helps to tell the story.<br />
Very good lightning&#8230; I love all those back lights.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0rpG7d6UBSo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDtS3dGAFqk">The Code’s Game</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AniMax4000?feature=watch">AniMax</a></h3>
<p>I don’t know the show they are referring to, but I catch the gist. What I like is the way there is a helicopter in the movie… without ever seeing it.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JDtS3dGAFqk?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best Space Themed movie (aka MonsieurCaron’s favorite)</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TXSU-C-uC4">Sector Se7en</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Olsonstudios?feature=watch">Spencer Olson Films</a></h3>
<p>Wow, the best short in my opinon. And it’s in Space, what can I ask more? The use of SFX for the holograph and the flying is very well done.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3TXSU-C-uC4?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88Q-SJLi5_Q">The Supervisor</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander?feature=watch">Legoander</a></h3>
<p>WOW. This is a simple yet effective little story. And well animated robots and humans.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/88Q-SJLi5_Q?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epzj1mWgJPg">Planet of the Sneeuwpop</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Annoying Noises Productions</a></h3>
<p>You gotta love the way those spacemen teleport.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/epzj1mWgJPg?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best use of microscale</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6NhmsuDNBs">Expectation</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lgfb1film?feature=watch">Loïc F-B</a></h3>
<p>Loïc F-B made good use of lightning in his film. I love his city landscape in forced perspective. I’m taking notes here for my own movies.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/v6NhmsuDNBs?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0SssMPCLlI">The Key</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BindingBrick?feature=watch">Binding Brick</a></h3>
<p>Making the spaceship in microscale was a great idea. A nice montage that goes well with the music.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/K0SssMPCLlI?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Most amazing integration of the mod element</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEA_4A8UOik">Mental</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheCWynns?feature=watch">Chris Wynn</a></h3>
<p>The way the MOD element (the letter T) is hidden is just awesome. Check the white walls.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DEA_4A8UOik?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best use of Chima</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80nZanGzxjo">AX 2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PritchardStudios?feature=watch">PritchardStudios</a></h3>
<p>Good use of Chima minifig and Chi bricks. I like the way we switch between worlds.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/80nZanGzxjo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best dream sequence</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW1z7E3JNqE">No Crawme Steals Christmas</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SpiderSock?feature=watch">Brickhead Productions</a></h3>
<p>You must see that cop sleeveless ! And… is that a song or what ? It’s a great movie!</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/dW1z7E3JNqE?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5x0Gm8IqSM">How I survived</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/filmyguy1?feature=watch">Sean Willets</a></h3>
<p>I could have put this one into the &#8220;Best use of microscale&#8221; too.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/C5x0Gm8IqSM?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h2>Best plot twist</h2>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3hQKqd8dSU">The Liberator</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bluper8?feature=watch">Bluper8</a></h3>
<p>There’s a good twist in this story.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/l3hQKqd8dSU?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<h3>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jA1rD2GjiYo">The Police Delivery</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ForlornCreature?feature=watch">ForlornCreature</a></h3>
<p>Another well animated good short story.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jA1rD2GjiYo?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s an annoying spot plaguing a man&#8217;s window, and it won&#8217;t go away. This new brickfilm from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander?feature=watch" target="_blank">Legoander</a> is nothing less than intriguing.</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Osf5PUND1_I?rel=0" height="360" width="640" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
<span id="more-1761"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s one of those videos that, by the time it was over, had me sitting and thinking. The animation, simple white set, and that truly bizarre red dot carried me through this three-minute short, but it didn&#8217;t stop there. Some of my favorite movies and animations are the ones that don&#8217;t have a conclusion. Sure, the video definitely had an ending, but it didn&#8217;t conclude. It doesn&#8217;t spoon feed the answer but begs for questions to be asked and things to be thought over.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think it means?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1714 alignleft" alt="2013 LEGO Entertainment Guide cover" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-210x300.jpg" width="210" height="300" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-210x300.jpg 210w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-719x1024.jpg 719w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm-700x996.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/2013LEG_cover_sm.jpg 1580w" sizes="(max-width: 210px) 100vw, 210px" /></p>
<p>I was intrigued to find this pamphlet tucked away inside the November-December 2013 issue of the LEGO Club Magazine. Billed as the &#8220;Special LEGO Video Guide&#8221;, it purports to feature the &#8220;top 2013 LEGO videos, free online games, apps, and more!&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, it&#8217;s just one big advertisement for LEGO multimedia content (much like what the Club Magazine itself is for LEGO toys). But it definitely points towards increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content, most likely in preparation for <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">the release of The LEGO Movie next February.</a><span id="more-1698"></span></p>
<p>And since &#8220;increased coverage/awareness of LEGO films and animated content&#8221; is our middle name here, I figured I&#8217;d take a second to walk you guys through this &#8220;Entertainment Guide&#8221; brochure&#8230;</p>
<h2>The Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cover is made up to look like an &#8220;Entertainment Weekly&#8221; magazine, both in terms of layout and font choice for the title. In fact, I&#8217;m kind of surprised they were able to get away with that. Parody&#8230; I guess?</li>
<li>Chase McCain is holding a LEGO Clapboard tile, which says &#8220;Awards!&#8221; on it. I&#8217;m not sure what that&#8217;s referring to, since there are no awards given or listed on the pages within. It almost feels like a movie industry word association game. &#8220;What are some other Hollywood-related words&#8230; how about &#8216;Awards&#8217;?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 1-2</h2>
<ul>
<li>The first spread is titled &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos!&#8221;, though based on the content being presented, that&#8217;s a pretty arbitrary label. All the videos in this pamphlet are official LEGO releases, which means they&#8217;re somewhat limited in scope. How or why these particular videos were chosen to be the &#8220;top&#8221; videos, it doesn&#8217;t say, but there was basically nothing noteworthy I hadn&#8217;t seen before.</li>
<li>Seeing the Paganomation-produced LEGO <a href="http://youtu.be/PXPA0fEU1aA">Superman</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/Rv4Mmkokexc">Iron Man</a> videos listed in there was a nice touch, though.</li>
<li>The only new content to catch my eye was not a video at all, but a notice for a &#8220;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">NEW FREE LEGO TV APP</a>&#8221; available on iTunes. This was the first I had ever heard of such an app existing; though, thanks to similar notices on subsequent pages, it was not the last.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 3-4</h2>
<ul>
<li>More of the &#8220;Top 2013 LEGO Videos&#8221;, including the &#8220;first trailer&#8221; for The LEGO Movie. <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/11/analyzing-the-new-lego-movie-trailer/">Didn&#8217;t the second trailer already come out?</a></li>
<li>I can appreciate how repetitive it must be to write short blurbs about so many conceptually similar LEGO videos, but some of the grammar/sentence structure in this brochure is kinda wonky. &#8220;How did it go from idea to finished LEGO Specials?&#8221; How indeed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 5-6</h2>
<ul>
<li>These pages focus on LEGO City video/game media from 2013. Page 6 is solely devoted to advertising a new LEGO City game for mobile devices.</li>
<li>Page 5 does focus on videos; though oddly, they&#8217;re all CGI entries. What&#8217;s weirder are the &#8220;milestone&#8221;-type captions on a few of the thumbnail images: &#8220;First Appearance of Dalmatian Firedog&#8221;! Oh&#8230; okay. &#8220;Most Minifigures in a Single Video!&#8221; Well, that&#8217;s not really true; it&#8217;s CG, so technically there are no minifigures in that video.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 7-8</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pages 7 and 8 feature an ad for the Cartoon Network &#8220;Legends of Chima&#8221; CG series, which I have yet to check out in any capacity.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pages 9-10</h2>
<ul>
<li>The spread on pages 9 and 10 is entitled, &#8220;Mini Movies&#8230; Big Creativity!&#8221;</li>
<li>Rather than focusing on specific video entries, these blurbs talk more generally about a few LEGO video genres &#8212; Microsquare (a series of Master Builder how-to videos), LEGO CGI Animation (technically a medium, not a genre), and Seasonal Shorts (Adventures of Max, the Brick-a-Brack Bunch, etc.).</li>
<li>More strange sentences: &#8220;Featuring the Brick-a-Brack Bunch<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />  on zany adventures, look for these videos during holidays and when the seasons change.&#8221; &#8220;A Club Member favorite, &#8216;Adventures of Max,&#8217; from the LEGO Club TV Show have been an online mainstay for a few years, following the LEGO Club mascot on adventures that take him under the sea, into outer space, and follow him through almost every LEGO line.&#8221;</li>
<li>And another ad touting &#8220;2 ways to watch: catch them all at <a href="http://www.lego.com/clubvideos">LEGO.com/clubvideos</a> OR Ask your parents to download the FREE LEGO TV APP on your iPhone or tablet.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Back Cover</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yet another ad for Legends of Chima.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Overall thoughts</h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest takeaway from this brochure is the existence of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lego-tv/id659284915">the LEGO TV mobile app</a>, which I think is pretty cool. Anything that gets LEGO videos further out into the public eye can only be a good thing, I think.</li>
<li>However, there are some inconsistencies. For example, our aforementioned LEGO Iron Man short is nowhere to be found on the LEGO TV app, despite the claim that all videos shown in the guide are available to watch on the app. I wonder how many other videos might have been lost in the void.</li>
<li>The other interesting thing I discovered via this brochure is the existence of yet another outlet for LEGO Video content. When the blurb mentioned checking out club videos on the LEGO website, I assumed it was talking about <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO Club Videos page.</a> In fact, it&#8217;s talking about something else entirely: <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">a Videos page on LEGO.com itself.</a></li>
<li>This newer videos page does seem to be more thorough than the Club Videos page ever was; though, on this new page, there is again <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos/themes/club">a subcategory for Club Videos</a>, effectively rendering the separate Club Videos page outmoded and redundant.</li>
<li>I am again baffled by the ways in which The LEGO Group continues <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/official-lego-youtube-channel/">the fracturing of their video releases</a>; especially when it&#8217;s clear from this brochure that they want more people to check out said videos. Now we&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lego">the official LEGO YouTube channel</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/legoclubtv">the old (dead) LEGO Club TV channel</a>, <a href="http://club.lego.com/en-us/videos">the Club Videos page</a>, <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/videos">the LEGO.com Videos page</a>, the LEGO Movie Maker App &#8220;Movie Gallery&#8221; section, the LEGO TV app, ReBrick.com&#8230; sheesh.</li>
<li>Why not just have ONE central location and drive all the traffic there? I get wanting to have as many people as possible see the video content itself, but this just feels like a big mess. I want to be able to come back to the same place every time and see all the video content there is; not have to figure out which videos were uploaded where, when, and then try to keep tabs on all of them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, what did you guys think of the The 2013 LEGO Club Entertainment Guide? Are you going to check out the LEGO TV app?</p>

<p>The LEGO YouTube channel has some new trailers for, uh&#8230; the upcoming new trailer&#8230; for The LEGO Movie.<span id="more-1654"></span></p>
<p>There are &#8220;Meet&#8221; previews for both <a href="http://youtu.be/ceDFQpoOV-c">Emmet</a> and <a href="http://youtu.be/DxHIOGIiz98">Wyldstyle</a> (a character I really, really wish had a different name), but not a ton of footage that&#8217;s terribly different from what we&#8217;ve seen before. I&#8217;m as excited for the movie as the next LEGO fan, but I feel like we&#8217;re in danger of being caught in an infinite hype loop.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 10/29/13:</strong> There&#8217;s <a href="http://youtu.be/fYv-xrTXhPE">a &#8220;Meet&#8221; preview up for President Business</a> now, which is actually my favorite of the three so far. It&#8217;s a nice little bit of insight into a character we know next to nothing about; plus, shameless LEGO fandom in the form of Octan shout-outs.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t feature this brick recreation of a small part of the &#8220;Thriller&#8221; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA&amp;t=1m53s">music video</a>.</p>

<p>You may remember when we featured Annette&#8217;s <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/03/michael-jacksons-moves/">last Michael Jackson brick animation</a> back in March. &#8220;<a href="https://vimeo.com/73564884#">LEGO Thriller</a>&#8221; is a step-up in terms of complexity and technique. Not only is it at a larger scale and resolution than her previous work, but her use of layering at key moments adds depth to the otherwise flat animation. It&#8217;s a powerful effect. I&#8217;m also quite fond of her use of upside down bricks to add a different texture to the girl&#8217;s shirt.<br />
Keep &#8217;em coming Annette!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conan O&#8217;Brien must have a connection with LEGO. Perhaps he has a passion for his favorite childhood toy that still burns.  We have noticed on quite a few occasions over the last few years that LEGO has been mentioned or showcased in comedy bits or interviews.  <span id="more-1581"></span>Conan was born in 1963 and young enough to have played with LEGO sets growing up, but probably ones without minifigures.</p>
<div style="width: 477px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img title="Conan and Indy?" alt="" src="http://www.gameinformer.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Blogs-Components-WeblogFiles/00-00-00-00-06/4403.Picture-3.png" width="467" height="263" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Late night talk show host Conan O&#8217;Brien got the LEGO treatment by the folks over at LucasArts as part of a promotion for LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Recently on his show, the actor Simon Pegg showed off his <a href="http://teamcoco.com/celebs/simon-pegg/photos/photo-30245" target="_blank">Shaun Of The Dead Action Figures</a>.  On another occasion, the actor Paul Rudd presented Conan with a picture of a custom mini-figure made by is his son during his <a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/paul-rudds-son-lego-maniac" target="_blank">interview</a> with Conan.  Brick artist Nathan Sawaya has built a couple of life-size sculptures of Conan. (The <a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/flaming-c-lego-time-lapse-nathan-sawaya" target="_blank">time lapse video</a> of Nathan working on one of the statues is amazing!)</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8489/8186740292_6d6edc2718_b.jpg" width="305" height="410" /><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://mimg.ugo.com/201101/6/9/2/171296/cuts/redhead1_786x1048.jpg" width="308" height="410" /></p>
<p>But&#8230;what we are most excited about is the connection Conan has with brickfilmers.</p>
<p>Last year, Conan had a brush with brickfilming fame in a Halloween store in Los Angeles.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/filmyguy1">Sean Willets</a>, aka filmyguy1, appears with Conan in the sexy outfit section of the costume shop.  (It&#8217;s near the 2 minute mark).  Sean&#8217;s mom also makes an appearance.</p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AmznnltVlmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Unfortunately no brickfilming was discussed.</p>
<p>Atticus Shaffer, star of TV show The Middle, discussed his love for making LEGO stop motion films during his interview with Conan.</p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/02qyV5LHUfg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Donald Faison, star of The Exes and Scrubs, discussed his passion for making LEGO stop motion with Conan.  Donald Faison is the man behind Black Storm Trooper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://bossip.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/picture-35-e1323818136717.png?w=287&amp;h=218&amp;crop=1" width="287" height="218" /></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YePE2tloDd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The mouth movements are done with stop motion.  Respect, man! Check out his interview on the Team Coco site (<a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/donald-faison-huge-blerd">part 1</a>, <a href="http://teamcoco.com/video/donald-faison-interview-pt-2-12-12-11">part 2</a>).</p>
<p>Conan played a few brickfilms on his television show.  One brickfilm that aired on Conan was by Grayson MacLean, the childhood inventor.  Grayson MacLean invented <a href="http://www.brickstix.com/">BrickStix</a> and was interviewed by Conan a few years ago.</p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/K7p7Xb5XluQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the extended version of Grayson&#8217;s brickfilm:</p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL00BBEBA81B47625A&#038;index=12" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Conan played yet another brickfilm on his television show called Cheer Up, Legos!  It was apparently produced by Conan&#8217;s team in response to news stories about LEGO not having as many smiles as they once did.  It&#8217;s quite funny.  <strong>Warning</strong>: it has some mature content, so view at your own discretion.</p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_9Ixf4gT7zI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>So Conan, when are you going to interview another brickfilmer or play another brickfilm on your show? We love it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdGrYlDaxYw">Major Malfunction</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MisterMulluc">MisterMulluc</a>, you are missing out on a fantastic five minute miracle of animation.</p>

<p>Okay, now that you&#8217;ve watched that, let&#8217;s talk about what makes it superlatively awesome. Amazing animation, creative character design, non-stop comedy, and great camera work, it&#8217;s got everything.. My only tiny criticism would be that there&#8217;s no real story (i.e. I don&#8217;t know why a robot is chasing two well-dressed chaps through a jungle), but then again it&#8217;s got about as much story as &#8220;Tom and Jerry&#8221; and most &#8220;Looney Tunes&#8221; cartoons. Also, that tiny complaint is buried under a mountain of adoration. I love the way the palm tree gets &#8220;bent&#8221; at 1:09, the way the guy with the hat keeps putting his hat back on, the absurdist touches like a sign with legs, the cartoonish back and forth starting at 3:20, and<strong> did I mention the piano-playing robot!?! </strong>Every action is well-motivated and fluidly animated. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than this.<strong></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most unique advertisements LEGO has done in recent years was for the launch of LEGO CL!CK—a <a href="http://www.legoclick.com/">website </a>highlighting LEGO bricks as part of the creative process. &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OinrOnjzH_A">CL!CK</a>&#8221; and its semi-sequel &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC0vb9XDz38">The Brick Thief</a>&#8221; are highly stylized stop-motion films that follow the adventures of a wacky inventor always in need of inspiration.<br />

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/F1Mt43J-vqk" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Story</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1546" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-300x196.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" width="300" height="196" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-300x196.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM-700x458.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.45.16-PM.png 703w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />In &#8220;CL!CK&#8221;, our wacky inventor (let&#8217;s call him Dr. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDH3AoOQzE0">Zach</a>arias <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego#1890s.E2.80.931950s">Playwell</a>) is trying to invent a way for humans to fly, he gets inspired after a visit to the Idea Factory. In &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; Dr. Playwell steals LEGO bricks from children so he can build a toy rock band and dance.</p>
<p>Both videos serve as charming parables about the creative process. &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; focuses on the frustration that comes from butting your head up against a problem repeatedly without knowing how to solve it, and the ensuing euphoria when you finally arrive at a solution. In short, it is a story about overcoming writer&#8217;s/inventor&#8217;s/creator&#8217;s block. The concept of the Idea Factory as the place to go to be inspired is a little half-baked (especially when you remember it is also a metaphor for the LEGO CL!CK website), but it serves its purpose.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1547" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-300x165.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-08-31 at 11.02.49 PM" width="300" height="165" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-300x165.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM-700x386.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.49-PM.png 843w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />If &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; is a story about writer&#8217;s block, then &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; is a story about how borrowing/stealing/remixing other people&#8217;s ideas is an essential part of the creative process. There&#8217;s less of a story arc here; Dr. Playwell doesn&#8217;t have what he needs, but then he gets it with little resistance. The stakes may be low, but the message is clear: LEGO is reaffirming it&#8217;s core principles as a toy of endless possibilities. It also works as a &#8220;so that&#8217;s where all the missing socks go&#8221; tale.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1549" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.43.52-PM.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" /></p>
<p>There is no dialogue in either film aside from Dr. Playwell&#8217;s frustrated grunts and jubilant &#8220;AHA!&#8221;s, so the storytelling is almost entirely visual. Question mark boxes float above Dr. Playwell&#8217;s head when he&#8217;s stumped, his ideas come to life on paper and in bricks, and his face says all we need to know.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-1551" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.01.32-PM.png" alt="The Brick Thief" width="305" height="168" />The set design of the laboratory evokes the stop-motion films of Jan Švankmejer. In particular, Dr. Playwell&#8217;s wall of tiny doors recalls Svankmejer&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/alice,26377/">Alice</a>&#8220;. The controlled playfulness of the Ideas Factory brings to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFeLKXbnxxg">Google campus</a> or <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2012/01/31/lego-pmd-by-rosan-bosch-and-rune-fjord/">the building where LEGO set designers work</a>. Creativity is portrayed simultaneously as messy and personal and as clean and corporate.</p>
<p>The dim, flickery lighting and vignetting makes the films feel like early silent films. This is an appropriate stylistic choice given the lack of dialogue. Makes me wish some one would do a Méliès homage brickfilm.</p>
<h2>Animation</h2>
<p>The first time I watched &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; I was blown away by the animation. I couldn&#8217;t believe that they had managed to do such intricate stop-motion of the LEGO models while also stop-animating the human actor. I was right not to believe.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1554" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM.png" alt="LEGO CL!CK" width="725" height="463" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM.png 725w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM-300x191.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-10.44.45-PM-700x447.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s not immediately obvious to the untrained eye (or, at least, wasn&#8217;t to mine), the animated LEGO bricks in these two films are photo-realistic CGI rather than physical LEGO bricks. The telltale sign is the unnatural sheen of the bricks; they are just a tad too luminous to be real. The CGI was done by <a href="https://vimeo.com/a52">a52</a>, which specializes in photo-real visual effects.</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-1556" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-08-31-at-11.02.23-PM.png" alt="The Brick Thief" width="302" height="158" />I wanted to highlight these films in light of the recent revelations that &#8220;<a href="http://brickanimation.com/tag/thelegomovie/">The LEGO Movie</a>&#8221; will employ a similar style of photo-realistic stop-motionesque CGI (though on a much grander scale). It is an interesting compromise that retains the stop-motion aesthetic while significantly reducing the cost/complexity. It is certainly preferable to the animation style of the Ninjago TV series which gives characters un-LEGO-like flexibility.</p>
<p>All that being said, the animation in &#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; is inventive and well-executed. Highlights include a rocket turning into shoe then into an exclamation point, a windmill that lets off musical notes, and the puffs of smoke coming out of the Idea factory.</p>
<p>Marius Begai also deserves mention here as the actor behind Dr. Playwell. His animated expressions are delightful and his stop-motion dance moves are enviable. Stop-motion acting is a unique skill, much like being a puppeteer and a puppet at the same time.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>&#8220;CL!CK&#8221; and &#8220;The Brick Thief&#8221; are different than the average LEGO commercial. They have a unique visual style and rather than selling the latest LEGO set, they have timeless messages about creativity. In this way, they are reminiscent of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBmYkiRwKQ">vintage</a> LEGO commercials.  I would love to see more LEGO commercials in this vein. &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIZ2lua9aQA">Build Together</a>&#8221; is the only comparable one I can think of from recent years.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s also important to evaluate these videos in the context of <a href="http://showcase.noagencyname.com/Lego/Click/">LEGO CL!CK writ large</a>. The LEGO CL!CK <a href="http://www.legoclick.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/legoclick?ref=ts">social</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/legoclick/">media</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/legoclick?feature=watch">channels</a> are now dormant, only a few years after they launched. They have become more cruft floating in the LEGO digital ocean. My guess is that they were either abandoned so LEGO could focus efforts on <a href="http://rebrick.lego.com">ReBrick,</a> or because they were being run by an ad agency and never intended to be long-term. There&#8217;s a parallel here to the many YouTubers who used to brickfilm and have either disappeared or turned into video game focused channels.</p>
<p>Even when it was actively updated, the CL!CK website was hard to use. Its Flash-based design means it won&#8217;t load on mobile devices. Pieces of content appear as giant teetering stack of LEGO bricks. It looks cool, but it is confusing to navigate. If you know how to find them, there are a few awesome micro-blogs by my illustrious co-editor, but it&#8217;s impossible for me to link directly to them. Given the emphasis placed these days on mobile-friendliness and content sharability, the LEGO CL!CK website serves as a stark reminder of how much web design standards have changed over the last few years.</p>
<p>In this sense, the LEGO CL!CK website becomes a parable for another part of the creative process: the idea that didn&#8217;t work. Despite winning a <a href="http://pereiraodell.com/news/silver-and-bronze-pencils-for-lego-clck">bunch</a> of advertising <a href="http://www.mjz.com/directors/blue-source/awards/">awards</a>, LEGO CL!CK has clearly not been a long-term success for LEGO. One of the things the LEGO Group does well is try out a wide variety of ideas and then focus their resources behind the ones that are successful. This means they have a lot of themes and products that are swiftly abandoned after only a year or two. LEGO CL!CK is another crumpled piece of paper in the great LEGO trash bin next to Galidor, LEGO Universe, and Clikits.</p>

<p>A host of new LEGO film and TV content has been added to Netflix. It&#8217;s all CG stuff, but cool nonetheless.</p>
<p><span id="more-1538"></span></p>
<p>Among the new titles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_Mask_of_Light_The_Movie/60029645?trkid=2361637">first</a> <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_2_Legends_of_Metru_Nui/70002933?trkid=2361637">two</a> Bionicle movies (joining <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Bionicle_3_Web_of_Shadows/70038640?trkid=2361637">the third one</a> that was already available)</li>
<li>The <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Atlantis/70275713?trkid=2361637">LEGO Atlantis</a> 22-minute short that aired on Cartoon Network a while back</li>
<li>A Hero Factory TV show two-parter called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Hero_Factory_Breakout/70276202?trkid=2361637">&#8220;Breakout&#8221;</a></li>
<li><a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Ninjago_Masters_of_Spinjitzu/70252973?trkid=7203170">Season 1 of Ninjago</a></li>
<li>A 22-minute LEGO Friends short called <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_Friends_New_Girl_in_Town/70275714?trkid=2361637">&#8220;New Girl In Town&#8221;</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of these, I&#8217;ve only managed to watch the Friends and Atlantis shorts. &#8220;New Girl In Town&#8221; has about as bland of a story as you&#8217;d imagine; though what really bothered me about it was the design of the thing. Every character has the same build and appearance, and can pretty much only be told apart by their hair and clothing. The men all look like 12-year-olds with beards (watch especially for the creepy mayor and his smooth dance moves), and everyone&#8217;s got bizarro mouth shapes that match their dialogue almost as often as they match the characters&#8217; emotion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, &#8220;Atlantis&#8221; plays out like a feature-length script that someone condensed into 22 minutes. It&#8217;s got no payoff, but it&#8217;s harmless fun with some neat characters and energetic voice acting. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth checking out, especially for kids who dig the sets.</p>
<p>Atlantis actually reminded me of a more successful version of &#8220;The Adventures of Clutch Powers&#8221;, particularly in the structure and characterization. &#8220;Old Guy, Meathead, Nerd, and The Girl all go off on an adventure where they use building skills to do&#8230; something.&#8221; <a href="http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/LEGO_The_Adventures_of_Clutch_Powers/70130180?trkid=2361637">Clutch Powers is also on Netflix</a>, but I&#8217;ll have to save my extended thoughts on that yawn-fest for another time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As writers of <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com">the Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild</a> Brickfilming News and Events Blog, we are constantly searching the internet for brickfilming news. We discovered that a few types of brickfilms get more online news coverage than others. <span id="more-1481"></span> There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much online news coverage about the average typical brickfilm.  There&#8217;s also not much coverage about fan made superhero or Star Wars brickfilms. Online news coverage, along with the views, generally goes to brickfilms that are: 1) recreations of movie trailers, 2) video game inspired, 3) sports re-enactments, 4) music videos of songs from popular artists, 5) marriage proposals, and 6) all the PR stuff about LEGO sponsored/produced CGI animations like Batman, Star Wars, and the upcoming LEGO Movie.</p>
<p>To narrow things down, let&#8217;s just look at the genre of brickfilm movie trailers. Movie trailers done as brickfilms are typically animated frame for frame to the existing original trailer&#8217;s soundtrack. I found nine movie trailers recreated in LEGO to examine and showcase.</p>
<p>1) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=c57lVldtENw">The Heat</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/grey4484">Garrett Barati</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/c57lVldtENw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I am a huge fan of Garrett Barati and I love this brickfilm movie trailer. The animation is very realistic and true to the original trailer. All of the props and scenery in the backgrounds give such depth to each scene. I especially like the floor patten in the police jail scene, simple with a nice addition. The real movie Heat had decent success at the box office, but the recreated version doesn&#8217;t have many views. It surely deserves more than it has right now. Perhaps the R rating hurts the potential audience that appreciates brickfilms.</p>
<p>2) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugsCigaRp-o">Wolverine</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ugsCigaRp-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Antonio Toscano has his niche in brickfilming. It&#8217;s making brickfilm movie trailers. He has found success in his brickfilm movie trailers as he has over a million views between his four trailers. &#8220;Wolverine&#8221; is Toscano&#8217;s most recent brickfilm movie trailer and is the first of four on this list of nine brickfilm trailers.  It currently has just over 10,000 views on YouTube. The sets and the lighting are all good and the energy of the animation totally works for the brickfilm trailer. The animation is a bit little choppy at times, but doesn&#8217;t distract or take away from this great brickfilm.</p>
<p>3) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7JGT0yxxMw">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7JGT0yxxMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This one is my favorite of Antonio Toscano&#8217;s brickfilm movie trailers. Maybe I just have a fondness for Star Trek. The micro-scale that was used in some of the scenes worked well. The trailer had a great selection of the minifigures. An <a href="http://www.itworld.com/internet/348999/mash-gold-star-trek-trailer-meets-lego">article about Toscano&#8217;s trailer</a> was written by ITWORLD.</p>
<p>4) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFLoAa00NFs">Lego Man of Steel Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bFLoAa00NFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This video has over a quarter million plus views on YouTube. It stays very true to the original trailer. There are a few issues with the animation here and there, but like some of the other Toscano&#8217;s brickfilms, it doesn&#8217;t hurt the energy of the recreation. <a href="http://entertainment.msn.co.nz/blog.aspx?blogentryid=1082918&amp;showcomments=true">EntertainmentFIX</a> and <a href="http://www.unleashthefanboy.com/news/man-of-steel-trailer-in-lego-glory/41076">Unleash the Fan Boy</a> wrote blogs about this video.</p>
<p>5) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO4fP1DwBeo">Iron Man 3 Trailer #2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/antoniotoscano87">Antonio Toscano</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mO4fP1DwBeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This brickfilm recreation is closing in on one million views. It&#8217;s loaded with extensive chroma keying that&#8217;s well achieved. The scene with the helicopters attacking Tony Stark&#8217;s home was the scene that worked best for me. Toscano had fun with this one. There are a few easter eggs that are hidden in the film. I also like Toscano&#8217;s style of making explosions with special effects. The explosions have a realness to them as they are not just keyed in explosions from <a href="http://www.detonationfilms.com/">Detonation Films</a>, the explosions use real bricks in the effects.</p>
<p>6) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EF7S3bSltTs">The Dark Knight Rises TRAILER#1 in LEGO!</a>&#8220;by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EF7S3bSltTs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is the first of the movie trailer recreations that have earned over one million views. It&#8217;s brilliantly done with great animation, lighting, special effects, and incredible CGI scenes. My complaint with this trailer has everything to with the original trailer, not Forrest Whaley&#8217;s recreation. There&#8217;s not enough Batman, I think he&#8217;s in only one scene. I want to see BATMAN! You can always count on Forrest for top notch brickfilms.</p>
<p>7) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5Zf7aol3oM">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 TRAILER</a>&#8221; in LEGO by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">forrestfire101</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/O5Zf7aol3oM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a first class professional grade recreation and my favorite of the two Forrestfire101 trailers on this list. It has great special effects, great lighting effects, and is also incredibly well animated. Forrest did not rely on CGI like his Dark Knight Rises Trailer. Forrest might be the king of college age humor using LEGO animation, but he can also make top notch movie trailers in LEGO. Kudos Forrest! It&#8217;s also great to be able to share a few of his brickfilms with our young daughter.</p>
<p>8) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEwUwslyaEQ">Dark Knight Rises Trailer 3: IN LEGO</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ParanickFilmz?feature=watch">ParanickFilmz</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dEwUwslyaEQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This is a very well done recreation, and must have taken ages to make. Some of the scenes rely on CGI and have a less of an authentic feel compared to the stop motion scenes. The mouth movements and facial animation are also well done. The lighting and special effects were superb. <a href="http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2012/12/watch-the-third-dark-knight-rises-trailer-recreated-with-lego/">Comic Book Creation</a> posted an article about this trailer.</p>
<p>9) &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l6PPvUhR4c&amp;list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&amp;index=9">Cars 2</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PatrickBoivin?feature=watch">Patrick Boivin</a></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL16F00D181B315ECD&#038;index=8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Patrick Boivin is a professional stop motion artist and it shows. Although he doesn&#8217;t work with LEGO for most of his animations, the Cars 2 Trailer that he created is one of the most impressive brickfilms that I have ever seen. This jaw dropping trailer was released back in 2011 and now has over ten million views. It was a paid commission work from LEGO, Disney, and Pixar. Mr. Boivin was not completely alone on this project. He had the benefit of getting help from a &#8220;builders team at LEGO&#8221; on the scenic elements. I wish I had a team like that for my brickfilms. The &#8220;facial&#8221; animations are top notch and don&#8217;t seem like some painted on effect done in post production. Folks, it doesn&#8217;t get any better than this.</p>

<p>The Set Bump turns one year old today! <span id="more-1423"></span></p>
<p>It was not so long ago (last August, in fact) that we said <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/hello-world/">&#8220;Hello World&#8221;</a> with our first post; kicking off a great year of news, reviews, editorials, and other animation-y brick-a-brack. In the coming year, we plan to continue upping the ante with all kinds of new content. You might have already seen the first result of our foray into the world of guest contributors &#8212; <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/07/its-a-great-time-to-brickfilm-and-heres-why/">A Repelling Spider&#8217;s post</a> about how, when it comes to animating with LEGO bricks, there is no time like the present.</p>
<p>Anyway, we&#8217;d like to extend a big thank-you to all our readers, commenters, and supporters for your continued interest in and feedback on our little corner of the internet. If all goes according to plan, year two should be even more interesting.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re making <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/07/more-details-about-the-lego-movie-from-comic-con/">a LEGO Movie</a>, after all!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ri6JvIMg9Sk" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ri6JvIMg9Sk" height="350" width="425" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /></object></p>
<p>I usually shy away from clicking &#8220;related videos&#8221; links &#8212; there are about 14.2 million LEGO videos on YouTube, and it&#8217;s way too easy to fall down an internet hole and never come out/get any work done.</p>
<p>This time my curiosity got the better of me,<span id="more-1270"></span> and I was delighted to find &#8220;Late for Work Again!&#8221; by <a href="http://www.brickabrackstudios.com">Brick a Brack Studios</a>. It&#8217;s your standard &#8220;Spider-Man on patrol&#8221; tale, but it&#8217;s got some neat touches. The dialogue and pacing are strong, there are some neat cameos (love the custom LEGO Marvel characters), and there&#8217;s a nice fourth wall break in the middle that leads to some interesting scale work. I think what really impressed me was how much it <em>felt</em> like a Spider-Man animated short &#8212; moreso than the last live-action movie, I&#8217;d say.</p>
<p>It may not be the most technically impressive short, but it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out. I guess <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/04/a-hidden-gem/">Dave was right to be curious</a> about the many hidden gems of brick animation waiting for us out there&#8230;</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never mentioned <a href="http://www.brickflix.org">The BrickFlix Film Festival</a> before! It&#8217;s not like <a href="http://brickflix.org/about/">I co-run it</a> or anything. <span id="more-174"></span></p>
<p>BrickFlix is a yearly screening held in Durham, NC at <a href="http://www.carolinatheatre.org/">The Carolina Theatre</a>. It started in 2010 as part of the <a href="http://brickmagic.org/">BrickMagic LEGO fan festival</a>, but has since branched off into it&#8217;s own event. As far as I know, it&#8217;s the only yearly screening in North America that showcases brick animation and other LEGO fan films in a real theater. And after each screening, there&#8217;s a Q&amp;A session where directors are invited to answer questions and talk about their films.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1249" alt="BrickFlix 2013 Panel" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC05255.jpg" width="1185" height="656" /></p>
<p>BrickFlix 2013 took place last week and, in addition to the 122 audience attendees, also saw our largest Q&amp;A panel ever! Directors from <a href="http://aquamorphproductions.com/">Aquamorph Productions</a>, <a href="http://animatostudios.blogspot.com/">Animato Studios</a>, <a href="http://sonjiracentral.webs.com/">Sonjira Central</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Annoying Noises Productions</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/KeeponBrickin">Lucasetak J</a> were all on hand to explain their inspirations, accomplishments, and techniques.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still waiting on confirmation for BrickFlix 2014, but as soon as we have a date, we&#8217;ll open it up for submissions. Rest assured that when the date is confirmed, I&#8217;ll let you know here. In the meantime, enjoy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxM0CTu_Y8w&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLeILYO3dehS8xTH9EfZvajECJrIOz0P5m">this year&#8217;s playlist!</a></p>

<p>What does this film have to do with LEGO? I have no idea, but there&#8217;s some cool stuff happening in here. I particularly like the brick-built 20th Centruy Fox and Chernin Entertainment logos, as well as the end title. I can&#8217;t find a 30-second edit of this trailer for comparison, but here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1O3iRdiplB0">the brick-free full version. </a></p>

<p>The first teaser trailer for the <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/">much-anticipated</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheLEGOMovie">&#8220;The LEGO® Movie&#8221;</a> is out, and I have to say&#8230; it looks pretty great.</p>
<p>Many of us (myself included) were dubious of the choice to go with computer graphics over stop-motion, but it seems like the filmmakers have embraced a kind of stop-motion style &#8212; minifigure characters with appropriately limited animation and ranges of motion. It reminds me a lot of the animation approach taken with the &#8220;Nicelander&#8221; characters in Wreck-It Ralph, which were given intentionally jerky movements to approximate a kind of 8-bit sensibility.</p>
<p>Anyway, between the fun animation, character designs, voice and fig choices, and overall vibe of the trailer, I am definitely sold. Might be time to go watch &#8220;Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs&#8221; again&#8230;</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a virus in your computer! But don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s adorable, and very-well animated. How has a great brick animation like &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxBvWPcPQiw">VIRUS</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fremanga?feature=watch">Fred Mangan</a> gone virtually unnoticed on YouTube for two years? You&#8217;d think that it would be a little more&#8230; viral (sorry, I couldn&#8217;t resist).</p>
<p>Seriously though, this is a high-caliber brick animation that you need to watch. The large-scale characters are expressive in their movements and the sets have just enough detail to be interesting. The sound design is perfectly matched to the action and the story is unusual enough to be interesting. Makes you wonder what else is waiting out there undiscovered in the depths of YouTube&#8230;</p>

<p>Last month I got to attend the world premiere of the new LEGO direct-to-video film, &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s a CG animated feature from TT Animation; an offshoot of <a href="http://www.ttgames.com/">Traveller&#8217;s Tales</a>, creators of the LEGO video games.</p>
<p>The &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; screening was held at <a href="http://www.paleycenter.org/2013-spring-lego-batman-the-movie/">The Paley Center for Media</a> in Manhattan, and featured a panel of guests including voice actors Troy Baker (Batman), Travis Willingham (Superman), and Clancy Brown (Lex Luthor), as well as director/producer Jon Burton and director of photography Jeremy Pardon.</p>
<p>Yes, you still need a DP on a production with no real cameras.</p>
<p>When this film was first announced, I heard many LEGO fans cry foul; wondering, &#8220;are they just going to edit the cut-scenes from the LEGO Batman 2 video game together and call it a &#8216;film&#8217;?&#8221; You can all rest easy; &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is more than that. The TT Animation team has put together a solid film that ranks up there with TLG&#8217;s previous home video releases, even surpassing them in some cases (I&#8217;m looking at you, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-The-Adventures-Clutch-Powers/dp/B0030ZIZRC">Clutch Powers</a>).</p>
<p>Which is not to say it&#8217;s a perfect film. &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; is TT Animation&#8217;s first venture into film-making, and there are some artifacts from that crossover. You might think I&#8217;m referring to the visuals &#8212; the entire film was made using TT&#8217;s game engine, making it essentially a feature-length machinima piece. But &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221; was rendered as a film and not as a real-time video game, so there are noticeable improvements in lighting, staging, animation, and picture quality. The director also called out a few set pieces that had been upgraded to CG LEGO brick-built status, having been simpler CG backgrounds in the game.</p>
<p>(One detail I found particularly amusing was that the production team added dust and scratches to the character textures, to make them seem more like real LEGO minifigs. While we&#8217;re constantly <a href="http://youtu.be/TjH7Iy2VsaQ?t=2m50s">working at Paganomation to remove imperfections</a> from real minifigs, the CG artists on this film spent time putting them in.)</p>
<p>In fact, it was actually the pacing of the film that felt the most like a video game. The story is entertaining and well-told, but it&#8217;s laid out in a strange, level-based way: action scene, story scene, action scene, story scene. This would work well in a video game, but it was a bit distracting at times to feel like I had to &#8220;complete&#8221; the action scenes in order to continue following the story. When the creators brought up the fact that they started working on this film <em>before</em> the LEGO Batman 2 video game, I was not terribly surprised.</p>
<p>Another thing that stuck out as a video game holdover was an unusual amount of violence in the film. Of course, it&#8217;s &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;, so it&#8217;s all very cartoony violence between super-powered heroes and villains, but it still struck me as odd. Nothing you&#8217;d need to shield your kids from, but kind of unnecessary at the same time.</p>
<p>All of this said, I really did enjoy &#8220;LEGO Batman&#8221;. It has a solid, funny, attention-keeping story, and some great voice acting. I think the voice actors were my favorite part of the film; probably helped in part by the Q&amp;A panel after the film (which also confirmed my belief that Clancy Brown is awesome).</p>

<p>The film had a nice balance between familiar voices, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317/?ref_=tt_cl_t1">Clancy Brown</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0667326/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Rob Paulsen</a>, and folks I&#8217;d never heard of, like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1684869/?ref_=tt_cl_t2">Troy Baker</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992184/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Travis Willingham</a> (although they both have super-long IMDb credits lists, so what do I know).</p>
<p>Stealing the show in the voice department, though, was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0772116/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Charlie Schlatter</a> as Robin. The Robin subplot got a bit uncomfortable at times; he&#8217;s not treated very well by some of the characters. But his performance was really funny, and his story has a satisfying arc that has him holding his own with the other heroes by the end of the film.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;d definitely recommend checking out &#8220;LEGO Batman: The Movie &#8211; DC Super Heroes Unite&#8221;. It&#8217;s one of the better entries in the LEGO home video pantheon &#8212; probably helped by the decades of development all of these DC characters have had. The Blu-ray/DVD drops May 21st, and you get a nifty Clark Kent minifigure with your purchase, so it&#8217;s win-win.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve heard us talk before about <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/the-lego-movie-what-we-know-so-far/">&#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;</a>, the forthcoming motion picture from the LEGO Group and Warner Brothers. You&#8217;ve also seen our posts regarding <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/10/rebrick-flick-halloween-competition-update/">various animation contests hosted by Rebrick.com</a>. Well, now the two have become one&#8230;</p>
<p>Starting today, brick animators will have the opportunity to submit a video of their own for the chance to be featured in &#8220;The LEGO Movie&#8221;. <a href="http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/BottomMenu/Blog/03182013-the-LEGO-movie-competition-with-ReBrick.aspx">From ReBrick.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between March 25<sup>th</sup> and May 6<sup>th</sup>, submit your video on ReBrick. The top 25 films with the most community votes will enter a final round of judging, and the winning video will be included in the upcoming movie!</p>
<p>The setup is that the evil Lord Business (played by nice guy Will Ferrell) is going to destroy the entire LEGO world. Emmet, the hero of our movie, inspires all of the citizens of the LEGO world to go out and create cool stuff that will stop him.</p>
<p>We need YOU to help make that cool stuff in LEGO bricks and then shoot your character creating that cool stuff on camera to use in our movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be honest, I found the contest summary a bit confusing, although the mods on ReBrick are answering questions in <a href="http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/BottomMenu/Blog/03182013-the-LEGO-movie-competition-with-ReBrick.aspx">the comments section</a>. Essentially, the entries for this contest are &#8220;video clips&#8221; and not &#8220;films&#8221; &#8212; that is, the point is not to tell a story, but to showcase some cool MOC quick-build action in a silent 15-30 second clip.  Here&#8217;s the rest of the guidelines as I understand them:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">The running time of your clip should be between 15 and 30 seconds long.</span></li>
<li>The final frame rate of your clip should be 24 frames per second. You can shoot on &#8220;ones&#8221; (24 unique frames per second) or &#8220;twos&#8221; (12 unique frames per second) or anything you want (probably a good idea to stick to factors of 24), as long as the final render is 24 fps.</li>
<li>Your clip should feature one &#8220;hero&#8221; character and one &#8220;prop&#8221; (the prop can be a vehicle, a piece of equipment, or some part of the hero&#8217;s environment).</li>
<li>Your clip must be uploaded to YouTube, and then bookmarked on ReBrick.com.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t add any sound or music, and don&#8217;t have any dialogue. If your clip wins the contest and gets featured in The LEGO Movie, they&#8217;ll add the sound design later.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t use any LEGO characters, sets, or pieces from licensed products, i.e. Disney, Marvel, DC, Lucasfilm, Nickelodeon, etc.</li>
<li>Keep your set together after you complete your animation &#8212; if you win, they might need to recreate it for additional scenes.</li>
<li><a href="http://rebrick.lego.com/en-US/BottomMenu/Blog/03182013-the-LEGO-movie-competition-with-ReBrick.aspx">The full rules can be found on the ReBrick.com post.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The contest is open for entries between now and May 6th &#8212; but, as with the previous ReBrick contests, the longer you wait, the less time you&#8217;ll have for people to vote for your entry. So get building!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.talking-animals.com/the-animals/annette-jung.html">Annette Jung</a> of <a href="http://www.talking-animals.com/">Talking Animals</a> animation studio has done the impossible and <a href="http://vimeo.com/60169112">perfectly captured</a> the King of Pop&#8217;s dance moves in LEGO. She side-skirts the limited articulation of the minifigure by using a top-down perspective on some basic bricks. This method essentially turns LEGO bricks into pixels. It&#8217;s a great technique to keep in mind when looking for creative approaches to brick animation.</p>
<p>Watching this makes me thinks of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson's_Moonwalker">Michael Jackson&#8217;s Moonwalker</a> for the Sega Genesis (the sprites in this animation are smaller, but more limber than those in the game).</li>
<li>The &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q27BfBkRHbs">Fell in Love with a Girl&#8221; music video</a> by Michel Gondry, one of the finest brick animations of all time. If you haven&#8217;t seen it, drop what you&#8217;re doing and watch it now. If you have seen it, go watch it again, because it&#8217;s just that good. Also, watch the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzebYFxuB-A">making-of video</a>.</li>

My French is <em>très</em> rusty, but even without understanding the language (thankfully, there are English captions) I was impressed by the lip-synced characters in &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/IxqKcetzWbo">Tout le bloc en parle</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MonsieurCaron">MonsieurCaron</a>. While there are an abundance of brick animations that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f848GaFNTc">add digital mouths to minifigs</a>, and a few that swap out physical minifig heads, it is very rare to see brick-built mouth animation. In fact, the only other examples I can think of are &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vsIvU3AZY">Country Buildin&#8217;</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUmIqxGIJo">Little Guys</a>&#8221; by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Paganomation">illustrious co-author</a> of this blog.</p>
<p>The influence of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; on &#8220;Tout le bloc en parle&#8221; is clear not only in the brick-built characters, but also in the use of forced perspective sets for the background. That doesn&#8217;t take anything away from MonsieurCaron&#8217;s considerable accomplishments here. The characters are well-designed and fluidly animated and I found the use of miniland scale (see chapter 4 of <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/01/unofficial-lego-builders-guide-2012/">The Unofficial Lego Builder&#8217;s Guide</a>) characters for the audience particularly inspired. I mention the clear heritage of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; mostly because it&#8217;s a good excuse to promote the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea5Ua_8LJZ0">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Bd9OVspMI">excellent</a> behind-the-scenes videos which show all that goes into to making an animation at this scale.</p>
<p>Also, vive les enseignants!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got some leftover Christmas gift cards that you&#8217;re looking to put to good use? Then might I recommend the recently-released second edition of the <a href="http://nostarch.com/legobuilder2">Unofficial LEGO Builders&#8217; Guide</a>, written by <a href="http://www.apotome.com/">Allan Bedford</a> and published by <a href="http://nostarch.com/">No Starch Press.</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the first edition as an indispensable part of my library for years now. Without it, there might not have ever been <a href="http://www.paganomation.com/littleguys">a &#8220;Little Guys!&#8221; film</a>, and who knows if I would be here talking to you guys right now! It was with this book that I first learned how to consider the different scales of my LEGO creations, to build curves, and to organize my collection in an efficient manner.</p>
<div id="attachment_912" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-912  " alt="The sample sphere from the ULBG was used as a basis for the character designs in &quot;Little Guys!&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg" width="480" height="392" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere.jpg 480w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LG-sphere-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The sample sphere from the ULBG was used as a basis for the character designs in &#8220;Little Guys!&#8221;</p></div>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in the Book</strong></p>
<p>The Unofficial LEGO Builder&#8217;s Guide is written as both an introduction to the hobby for new LEGO fans and as a reference guide for expert builders and AFOLs. The ten chapters of the book cover the various scales of building, different artistic media (sculptures, mosaics, etc.), and the planning, setup, and execution of whatever MOCs you decide to build.</p>
<div style="width: 298px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/paganomation/6179650301/in/set-72157627621860773/"><img class=" " alt="Skull Island design grid" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6178/6179650301_df7ac427b2_z.jpg" width="288" height="384" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Skull Island design, from Red Brick Saga Pirates of the Caribbean &#8212; design grid and final version</p></div>
<p>There&#8217;s also the &#8220;Brickopedia&#8221;, an abridged listing of some of the more common LEGO parts and elements, sorted by category. This can be useful if you need a quick reference for a part name or number, or if you&#8217;re just looking for some inspiration for your own brick sorting approach. Granted, a lot of this information is also online, but there&#8217;s something to be said for the condensed economy of having a book in front of you.</p>
<p>Finally, the latter part of the book also showcases LEGO-scaled design grids, with an explanation of how they work as well as links to download and print them yourself. These can be extremely helpful if you&#8217;re trying to design something to fit within a certain space, or if you just want to sketch out an idea before committing it to brick. (We use these all the time over at Paganomation.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Differences in the Second Edition</strong></p>
<p>Having poured over the original book back when it first came out, I was curious to see what changes would be in the new edition. The most obvious one is plastered right on the cover: the second edition does have color photos and instructions. But I was a bit surprised when physically comparing both books&#8230;  the second edition is way thinner!</p>
<div id="attachment_921" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-921  " alt="First edition: approx. 7/8&quot;. Second edition: approx. 1/2&quot;" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg" width="600" height="326" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes.jpg 600w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ulbg_sizes-300x163.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First edition: approx. 7/8&#8243;. Second edition: approx. 1/2&#8243;</p></div>
<p>The new book has 10 chapters, down from 13 in the original. Gone are the sections on sorting and storage, tools for building (a bit on brick separation has been rolled into chapter 2), and Technic building (probably because <a href="http://nostarch.com/technicbuilder">there&#8217;s a whole other new book devoted to it now</a>).</p>
<p>The other differences are a bit more subtle:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Brickopedia has been whittled down, from 55 pages in edition 1 to 41 pages in edition 2.</li>
<li>Some brief, potentially redundant bits on scale have been removed from the Microscale chapter.</li>
<li>A section on writing reviews in the &#8220;Beyond Just Bricks&#8221; chapter is gone.</li>
<li>Other assorted edits and minor rearrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I wouldn&#8217;t say these changes hurt the book in any way. The ULBG has just become a more streamlined version of itself&#8230; which is the whole point of putting out a new edition of a book!</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How this relates to Brick Animation</strong></p>
<p>I came to the ULBG from the perspective of both a LEGO fan and an animator. Just like with any form of artistry, there are many tips, tricks and lessons that crossover from one medium to another. Here are a few that I took note of&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 70 talks about Miniland scale facades, and how it can be advantageous to only concentrate on perfecting the parts of your model that will be seen by your audience. Hmm&#8230; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaTIZdTAZ_k">sounds familiar.</a></li>
<li>A section of the Jumbo Elements chapter (p. 78) mentions the importance of testing, tinkering, and trial-and-error to get the results you want.</li>
<li>The chapter on Sculpture talks about using reference material when designing and planning your work (p. 109).</li>
<li>Page 82 has probably the most helpful, universal advice any artist can use: &#8220;Make things only as complicated as they need to be and no more.&#8221; The bottom line? Simple is good.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of LEGO reference books has been steadily increasing in recent years, which makes sense given the flourishing LEGO fan community. Despite being one of the earlier entries in this catalog, I recommend The Unofficial LEGO Builder&#8217;s guide as essential reference material for any brick animator or LEGO fan; young or old, novice or veteran.</p>
<p>(Plus, it&#8217;s now also available as an ebook&#8230; hello, iPad.)</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a neat video wherein a minifigure waxes poetic about the potential and possibilities of LEGO bricks. While I think it could have benefited from being about 30-60 seconds shorter, it&#8217;s definitely worth checking out &#8212; it&#8217;s got lots of great animation bits, and some clever dialogue and gags.</p>
<p>I caught it on <a href="http://youtube.com/lego">the official LEGO YouTube channel</a>, which <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/official-lego-youtube-channel/">we&#8217;ve mentioned before.</a> There&#8217;s still no sign of comments or consistent descriptions on these *official* videos&#8230; and therefore, I have no clue who made this video, when, or for what. Any ideas, dear readers?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://miff.machinimainteractivefilmfestival.com">The Machinima Interactive Film Festival</a> hosted a video contest recently; and, as with many online video contests, there were a few LEGO-animated entries amongst the ranks&#8230;<span id="more-796"></span></p>
<hr />
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6V0R8Qpjl8Q" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>First up, in the ACTION/DRAMA ANIMATION category, is &#8220;LEGO Portal 2 Part 1/2&#8221; by Kooberz Studios. Director Alex Kobbs has made a name for himself creating LEGO versions of popular video game properties (you can check out more on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Kooberz">his YouTube channel</a>), so in many ways, this contest was tailor-made for his work. There are a few neat animation techniques in the video, but what I was most impressed with was the sets &#8212; some really cool, detailed renditions of Portal 2 environments and backgrounds, and a ball-jointed GLaDOS that works really well.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I&#8217;ve only played through Portal 1, though 2 is sitting on my shelf, waiting for a day when I actually have some free time.)</p>
<p>Of course, like many LEGO-animated video game adaptations, there&#8217;s not much in the way of story here. This video is billed as a part 1 of 2, and I honestly can&#8217;t imagine what part 2 would be apart from more of the same. The video plays out like a clips show of game scenes, presented in a sort of Robot Chicken-esque channel surfing format. If you&#8217;ve never played any of the Portal games (or Half-Life, which I am assuming is where those characters who show up at the end are from), there may not be as much for you here, apart from some cool MOCs and animation bits. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://youtu.be/LE2_36xExKo">a behind-the-scenes video</a>, which is something I always love seeing from other artists.</p>
<hr />
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xtUSteNQOpw" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Next we have an entry from The Four Monkeys: a pretty faithful recreation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkoHAzjnUs">the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer</a>. The audio in their video comes directly from the real trailer; and with it, a storyline for the game told in voice over. Again, we have some really great set pieces that are pretty well matched to the trailer they come from.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-834" title="4monkeys_gta5" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-700x393.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I was also really impressed by a few particular moments &#8212; the shot of the guy on the jetski, the microscale city shot at 0:49, and the driving scene at 1:00. There&#8217;s a surprising amount of chroma keying, but it works and isn&#8217;t distracting. This is a solid piece, with as solid of a storyline as the source material allows. (I know I keep bringing up storylines; more on that in a moment.)</p>
<hr />
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9WflM7m343k" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s &#8220;LEGO The Battle of Helm&#8217;s Deep&#8221;, a Lord of the Rings-themed sketch from Brotherhood Workshop (whom we&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/wi-fi-uruk-hai/">once</a> or <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/11/keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe/">twice</a> before). The film has some really nice lighting and shot composition, sweet battle scenes (check out those crowds of warriors!), and consistently well-animated minifigs. Again, I&#8217;m not terribly familiar with the source material, but I know enough to say that Legolas is the star here, and his skidding-into-frame and &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the boooooox&#8221; animation are my favorite parts of this short. I assume the &#8220;get you a box to stand on&#8221; bit comes from one of the movies, and while I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s enough for 2-and-a-half minutes of story, it is a great excuse for some LotR homage action.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, the entries here are heavy on visuals and light on story; perhaps appropriate for what I&#8217;m assuming was a video game themed contest (admittedly I&#8217;m still a bit confused as to how LotR fits into that). It looks like voting took place on Twitter and ended December 8th, so we should be seeing the winners soon!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of these properties, I definitely recommend giving these entries a watch. If not, there&#8217;s at least some cool brick animation to check out!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MlCHAELHlCKOXFilms">Michael Hickox</a> is something of a phenomenon. With nearly 60,000 YouTube subscribers he is certainly one of the most popular brick animators out there today. <span id="more-814"></span>(The only two I can think of with more subscribers are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Keshen8">Keshen8</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/forrestfire101">ForrestFire101</a>.) His fame is well earned, his animations are always well done. He animates simple scenes from everyday life and infuses them with LEGO charm and humor. With straightforward titles such as &#8220;Lego School,&#8221; &#8220;Lego Mini Golf,&#8221; &#8220;Lego Birthday Party&#8221; and, of course, his break-out hit &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUfM0oA8Q8E">Lego Pizza Delivery</a>,&#8221; his animations lay their cards on the table before you even click play. You always know what you&#8217;re going to get with a Michael Hickox production.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FAt7ze-QLQ">LEGO Shopping</a>&#8221; focuses on frustrating minutia that can accompany a simple trip to the store: not finding a good parking space, getting the shopping cart with funky wheels, etc. The most entertaining bits come when a LEGO twist is put on these activities. For instance the frustrated minifig simply rebuilds his car when he can&#8217;t find a parking spot, minifigs partially disassemble themselves to try on different clothes, etc.</p>
<p>Michael Hickox is a great animator with a great command of visual language, his ability to tell a story without any words is enviable. Most of his films are entirely silent save for well placed music and sound effects. So I found it very jarring when the main character turned to the camera at 3:54 to make a comment about LEGO fashion that had already been adequately made visually. The voices continue after that, but I don&#8217;t think they add anything essential to the animation. The old adage &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; applies here, especially since Michael does such a great job showing.</p>

<p>While this doesn&#8217;t fit the traditional definition of what we&#8217;d consider a brick animation (there&#8217;s no stop motion involved), it&#8217;s too cool not to share here. While there are a lot of fan creations that include motorized elements, this is the first I&#8217;ve seen that tells a complete story (albeit a short one). I&#8217;m sure the programming and design of this creation was just as complicated and time-consuming as any animation. </p>
<p>What other LEGO fan creations have you seen that incorporate motorized elements like this?</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&#038;v=5850ssSM2aA#!">LEGO Indiana Jones and the Mystical Gemstone</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kd2apoof">kd2apoof</a> came out of nowhere for me. One of the best things about the brick animation community is when a total stranger from another continent uploads an amazing video that they <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=76414">spent years making</a> and you stumble upon it by chance. It just reinforces the fact that it&#8217;s possible for anyone to make a great animation if they put the work in.</p>
<p>This animation starts off with an homage to the opening scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark (not to be confused with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egPgU5kAjKE">this shot-for-shot recreation</a>) and then gets into a sequences of fights and chases that are entertaining, if unmotivated. The cinematography and sound design are the most impressive aspects, but the use of facial animation is under. I also like the use of actual rocks and dirt in the sets. Totally lacking in story, this brick animation is on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijpH6an-JIQ">impressive-solely-for-its-technical-achievements</a> end of the spectrum, but still well worth a watch.</p>
<p>P.S. For a brick animation that came out of the blue (for me) from France that is impressive for its story as well as technical achievements, make sure you check out &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hmb0qVSd2rY">Henri &#038; Edmond &#8211; Droits d&#8217;auteur</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/studiosepsilon">studiosepsilon</a> if you haven&#8217;t already. It&#8217;s one of my all-time favorites and I&#8217;ve been meaning to do a full review here for a while.</p>

<p>I watched/played &#8220;Lego Adventures&#8221; by MySnailEatsPizza1 back when it first came out and really enjoyed it,<span id="more-769"></span> but I was waiting for the results in the Bricks in Motion Kitchen Sink Contest to be announced before I did shared it here. Now that they&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/15695/bim-2012-kitchen-sink-results/">been announced</a> I can say that this interactive film deserves its first place finish.</p>
<p>Like any good interactive branching narrative, there are lots of different paths you can take in &#8220;Lego Adventures.&#8221; Some are dead ends, some are infinite loops, and all of them are a lot of fun (SPOILER: <span style="color: #ffffff;">you haven&#8217;t really won until you have a pet dragon</span>). The animation and sets in &#8220;Lego Adventures&#8221; are decent and serve their purpose. The story is a bit convoluted (like any good interactive branching narrative), and seems mostly to exist to tie together some disparate set pieces (superhero fight, escaping a military base, a day at the zoo)  the animator envisioned, but in a contest called Kitchen Sink, you can&#8217;t really fault the winner for taking a grab-bag approach. Take some time and play through it, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven&#8217;t seen it before, don&#8217;t miss the archetypical interactive brick animation, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtG6yw2IrlI">Ronald has a Spider on His Head</a>,&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SpastikChuwawa">SpastikChuwawa</a>.</p>

This is a great example of how Hero Factory characters lend themselves to more subtle expressions than their minifig counterparts. It also reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter's_Laboratory#The_Justice_Friends">Justice Friends</a>, and anything that reminds me of Dexter&#8217;s Laboratory is a good thing.</p>

<p>Kevin Ulrich of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/BrotherhoodWorkshop">Brotherhood Workshop</a> shares some of the secrets to his incredibly well animated Lord of the Rings brick animations in an equally well produced behind-the-scenes video. I particularly liked his discussion of how he builds his sets using sticks and rocks and why he prefers animating on clay to LEGO surfaces. He does a mean Gollum impression too.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Machine&#8221; is the latest of a <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/09/attack-of-the-50-foot-sibling/">handful</a> of brick animations that blur the line between stop-motion and live action. <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/post/285864/#p285864">According to the animator</a>, it was filmed at 25 frames per second (FPS), and had motion blur added in post-production to make it ever smoother. The short is worth a quick watch for the great cinematography and the inspired animation of the eponymous machine, but I&#8217;m mostly using it to launch into a larger discussion of FPS.</p>
<p>Choosing an FPS is an important part of making an animation, there is a constant balancing act between the smoothness of the animation and time required to make it. An animation set at 5 FPS is bound to look jumpy, but it can still be engaging (this is the frame rate I recommend for beginners). As the FPS increases (10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30), the animation gets smoother, but the time investment to create it rises steeply. Many brick animators settle at 15 FPS as a good balance between smoothness and amount of time invested, but there are a few that venture into those high ranges.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sWwMDbspO7g?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The best cautionary tale in this respect is &#8220;Dr. Jobs and his Scary Laboratory.&#8221; While the single completed episode of this series features some of the smoothest animation I&#8217;ve ever seen in a brick animation, the incompleteness of the remaining segments stands as a testament to the dangers of independent animators pursuing hyper-real frame rates. But let&#8217;s pretend for a minute that time is not an obstacle, what would the optimal frame rate for brick animations be? Is super-smooth, life-like animation the end-all be-all?</p>
<p>Personally, I think very high frame rate animations can feel sterile, and I find attempts to perfectly simulate real motion in animation to be uncanny. I am reminded of Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s essay on <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/55/baudrillard55art.htm">Simulacra and Science Fiction</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no more fiction&#8230; it is the real which has become our true utopia&#8230; presented with transparent precision, but totally lacking substance, having been derealized and hyperrealized.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do you think? The more frames per second the better? Or is the charm and art of animation precisely in the frames an animator chooses to include (and which to exclude)?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Grand Prize is a LEGO® Monster Fighters Haunted House signed by LEGO designer Adam Grabowski and a LEGO® Monster Fighters Exclusive Grab Bag &#8212; so that&#8217;s pretty cool!</p>
<p>I also asked ReBrick editor-in-chief Signe for a bit of clarification on the &#8220;Entries must only contain elements from the LEGO® collection&#8221; caveat, and here&#8217;s what she had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-US">Q: Do the films have to contain things specifically from the &#8220;Monster Fighters&#8221; play theme?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #1f497d;" lang="EN-US">A: No, we just think the Monster Fighters theme is great for Halloween, and that’s why we chose to highlight that theme.</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">Q: Or does it mean that the films in general must use only LEGO parts (and nothing from competing brands)?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #1f497d;" lang="EN-US">A: Yes, exactly. No competing brands. And don’t dress up in homemade Halloween Minifigure costumes, it’s only LEGO products you can use in the film ;o)</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-US">Q: Can people make films using any LEGO sets or parts they want, as long as the topic is appropriately spooky?</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #1f497d;" lang="EN-US">A: You can use any part/set from the LEGO collection you want. We want a Halloween film, so spooky with a twist of fun. </span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you go, guys and gals! Better get building&#8230; the contest is only open until October 29th!</p>

In the magical land of Riigo-Faloo, sharks and clowns hate each other like pirates and ninjas do in <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pirates-vs-ninjas">Internet lore</a>. Many thanks to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Harrison Allen</a> for his informative docudrama about this tragic feud.</p>
<p>What makes &#8220;Sharks and Clowns&#8221; memorable is a creative story told in an interesting way. I love the way elements pop into existence as they are described by the narrator. The animation of the giant squid and cackling Clown King are also highlights. The voices are difficult to understand at certain points and there is some distracting light flicker on the close-up shots, but overall this is a well-done animation with lots of clever moments. Be sure to check out the <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/post/281726/#p281726">discussion on Bricks in Motion</a> to see photos of Harrison&#8217;s lighting set-up for the flames.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also don&#8217;t miss <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/annoying-noises-productions/the-making-of-sharks-and-clowns/454153441274670">this behind-the-scenes post</a> on the Annoying Noises Facebook page.</p>

<p>I know very little about the shows involved, so any humorous aside or snarky wordplay you might imagine will be better than what I would have come up with here. Cool sets and some NPU, though.</p>

<p>17-year-old <a href="http://twitter.com/DylanWoodley">Dylan Woodley</a> of <a href="http://insomniacanimations.com">Insomniac Animations</a> made this really sweet music video for the song &#8220;Houdini&#8221; by <a href="http://www.fosterthepeople.com/">Foster the People</a>. There&#8217;s nothing terribly noteworthy about the animation or story &#8212; the video does drag in a few parts &#8212; but the real triumph here is in the staging and lighting of the piece. There&#8217;s some really amazing camera moves and transitions, and the whole thing feels like a true live-action concert video. My only wish is that he&#8217;d secure permission to use the song &#8212; I&#8217;d love to screen this video at <a href="http://www.brickflix.org">BrickFlix</a>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;hl=en_US" height="397" width="705" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
A few days ago, my co-author uploaded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgAzSLSioxI">the fourth</a> of five behind-the-scenes videos for four commercials his company produced for the LEGO Group last year, collectively referred to as the &#8220;Red Brick Saga.&#8221; As an animator, these &#8220;making of&#8221; videos are, in some ways, more enjoyable that the four branded shorts. Not only does David explain many of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ONUUHhUWVw&amp;feature=BFa&amp;t=3m16s">cool tricks and techniques</a> used in each short, but we get to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjH7Iy2VsaQ&amp;feature=BFa&amp;t=3m58s">his team at work</a>, which helps remind us of the countless painstaking hours that went in to each of these 30-second short videos.</p>
<p>But since this is a review, I should probably talk about the actual videos rather than the behind-the-scenes features. Each 30-second short features a different product line that was on shelves in summer 2011: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGifv_Xs-1Q&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">Pirates of the Caribbean</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9WvYYrlDAs&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=2&amp;feature=plpp_video">Harry Potter</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfwKRq3voQI&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plpp_video">Alien Conquest</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6q9QUH52Ac&amp;list=PLD0F8978A88A0DC01&amp;index=4&amp;feature=plpp_video">Star Wars</a>. The connecting thread is a red 2&#215;4 brick that flies through each setting indiscriminately wreaking havoc, much like a mischievous pixie. Each video has a madcap pace, rushing from scene to scene with little explanation or closure. Did Jack Sparrow escape safely? Did the humans fight off the alien invasion? No time for answers, the red brick is off on another adventure!</p>
<p>While the shorts may not provide much narrative substance, there is plenty of spectacle to enjoy over repeat viewings. The animation is so fast and buttery smooth, you may not appreciate how good it is until you see some of it slowed down in the behind-the-scenes videos (e.g. the brick-built explosions). The Alien Conquest short is full of great &#8220;blink and you&#8217;ll miss it&#8221; moments like the screaming crowd running away from the tripod walker. The design of each short is clean, professional, and suited to the subject matter. The Star Wars short does an excellent job recreating the iconic Death Star hanger (the lighting of the walls is particularly impressive), and you have to love the tiny bricks circling around the dazed Darth Vader&#8217;s head. Fans of the licensed properties will notice cameos from popular characters. The hallway scene in the Harry Potter short is particularly notable for this, but careful viewers will also notice a white Boba Fett in the Death Star hanger. As always, the Paganomation team uses LEGO bricks in inventive ways, such as a simple hinge brick to represent birds flying in the distance in the Pirates of the Caribbean short.</p>
<p>All told, there&#8217;s a lot of detail packed into a short amount of time. Which is another reason it&#8217;s best to mull over them while watching the behind-the-scenes videos <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Eric J. Nelson of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/heavyvis">Heavy Visuals</a> brings us this cute LEGO City promo, which I assume was for one of the <a href="http://tongal.com/sponsor/LEGO">Tongal LEGO contests</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a neat short, with some nice animation and cool music (which for some reason reminds me of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hx4Gsp5rcwM">Super Metroid</a>). The use of a LEGO train to transition from live-action to stop-motion is particularly inspired &#8212; though Heavy Visuals&#8217; work always seems to exist in some interesting middle ground between live-action and stop-motion. Apart from some minor technical failings (mostly color keying artifacts), it&#8217;s pretty solid.</p>
<p>Plus, it&#8217;s got graham crackers. Check it out, before the whole city is destroyed!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" title="LEGO: The Motion Picture" alt="LEGO: The Motion Picture" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGO_motion_picture.jpg" width="580" height="215" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGO_motion_picture.jpg 580w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGO_motion_picture-300x111.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" />It&#8217;s been three years since <a href="http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007162?refCatId=1236">we first got word</a> that a &#8220;LEGO movie&#8221; was in development over at Warner Brothers. Since that initial announcement, they&#8217;ve released some tidbits about the film <a href="http://screenrant.com/lego-movie-producer-dan-lin-plot-story-character-ideas-ross-38383/">here</a> and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5859181/lego-film-on-schedule-for-2014-release">there</a>, but it&#8217;s been piecemeal at best. And in this weird, modern, publicity-driven movie making landscape, I can&#8217;t tell whether that&#8217;s a good or a bad thing.</p>
<p>Technically, this won&#8217;t be the first official LEGO feature &#8212; there are the four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bionicle_media">Bionicle films</a>, as well as <a href="http://legoclutchpowers.com/">The Adventures of Clutch Powers</a>; though these are all direct-to-DVD releases. (Also, did you know they&#8217;re planning <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/universal-lego-hero-factory-robots-movie-328785">a live-action Hero Factory movie?</a>) I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll cover all of these films on this site at some point, despite the fact that they&#8217;re CG animated and not what we classify as true &#8220;LEGO Animation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Anyway, from what we know, &#8220;LEGO: The Motion Picture&#8221; won&#8217;t fall into that category, either, as it will be mostly CGI with some live-action photography. Other information about the film that has been released thus far (some of it just rumors, I&#8217;m sure):</p>
<ul>
<li>The release date of the film (as of this writing) <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LegoMovie/info">has been announced as February 28, 2014</a>.</li>
<li>The working title (according to the often-misinformed IMDb) is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1490017/">&#8220;LEGO: The Piece of Resistance&#8221;</a>.</li>
<li>The film&#8217;s story was penned by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1087952/">Dan</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1156984/">Kevin Hageman</a>, who previously worked on the &#8220;<a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/ninjago/index.html">Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu</a>&#8221; animated series on Cartoon Network, as well as the forthcoming animated feature &#8220;<a href="http://www.hotelt-movie.net/">Hotel Transylvania</a>&#8220;.</li>
<li>Also credited as writers are co-directors <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0520488/">Phil Lord</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0588087/">Chris Miller</a>, known for the surprisingly delightful &#8220;<a href="http://www.cloudywithachanceofmeatballs.com/">Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs</a>&#8221; film adaptation.</li>
<li>In <a href="http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2012/03/14/lego-movie-writerdirectors-explain-crazy-premise-for-the-film/">an interview with MTV</a>, the two directors discuss the plot of the film, and how it&#8217;s &#8220;weird, in a great way.&#8221; (Color me intrigued.)</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.nbc.com/parks-and-recreation/">Parks and Recreation</a>&#8221; actor <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-06-27/news/32445016_1_piece-of-resistance-channing-tatum-video-game">Chris Pratt has been cast as &#8220;Emmett&#8221;</a>, the main character of the film.</li>
<li><a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-06-27/news/32445016_1_piece-of-resistance-channing-tatum-video-game">Will Arnett has apparently signed on to voice Batman</a> (a minifigure Batman, I&#8217;m assuming). My gut is telling me &#8220;awesome!&#8221;&#8230; but my gut is also very hungry.</li>
<li>Finally, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.legothemotionpicture.com">LEGOTheMotionPicture.com</a>, where you can enter a <a href="http://youtu.be/jKBH36LwlCo">vehicle design contest</a> for a chance to have one of your LEGO creations featured in the film. There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LegoMovie">Facebook fan page</a> if you&#8217;re into that sort of thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you guys think? Does the &#8220;LEGO Movie&#8221; sound like something you&#8217;d go see?</p>
<h3>UPDATE [08/29/12 11:00am EDT]</h3>
<p>Apparently production folks&#8217; ears must have been burning as I wrote this post, because just as it went live, some new casting and plot information started floating around:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/warner-bros-builds-morgan-freeman-and-elizabeth-banks-into-lego-feature/">Morgan Freeman has been cast as someone called &#8220;Vitruvius&#8221;</a>; possibly named after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">the Roman architect</a> (or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man">a Da Vinci reference</a>)?</li>
<li><a href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/warner-bros-builds-morgan-freeman-and-elizabeth-banks-into-lego-feature/">Elizabeth Banks has been cast as someone TBA.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.deadline.com/2012/08/warner-bros-builds-morgan-freeman-and-elizabeth-banks-into-lego-feature/">Australian animation house Animal Logic will do the CGI work.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nme.com/filmandtv/news/morgan-freeman-to-star-in-lego-movie/282810">The film&#8217;s plot on IMDb</a>: &#8220;An ordinary Lego mini-figure, mistakenly thought to be the extraordinary MasterBuilder, is recruited to join a quest to stop an evil Lego tyrant from gluing the universe together.&#8221;</li>
<li><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5938720/a-lego-movie-is-happening-movie-stars-sign-up-to-play-lego-people">Some alternate plot info from Gizmodo.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/LegoTheMovie">A twitter account for the film.</a></li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjM9cEg2nbM">Barney&#8217;s cherry</a>&#8221; in the Eurobricks <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showforum=120">Brick Flicks and Comics forum</a> last weekend, I started wondering why animations starring Fabuland characters are so frequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">Lynchian</a>. Considering Fabuland was originally marketed at children ages 4-8, there is an alarmingly high occurrence of hallucinatory imagery, adult language, and graphic violence in these animations. There aren&#8217;t many Fabuland animations to begin with, so this list could also be called &#8220;The 7 Best Fabuland Animations,&#8221; but ranking them in order of weirdness is a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>1) &#8220;Mein Herz [My Heart]&#8221; by Pawnshop Orchestra (2006)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oGoXydXBwCo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This music video is probably the most straightforward Fabuland animation out there. A cat and a goat are in love, but far apart. The goat overcomes distance and an octopus to be reunited with his true love. Short, sweet, and barely weird.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; by FilmFair (1987)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dGFFmcu6mTc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>&#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; was an officially licensed series to promote the Fabuland sets. However, rather than using actual Fabuland products, the characters are made of clay, allowing for a much greater range of expression. This series is standard kid show fare; each episode presents a small challenge that is overcome in a friendly manner. The only weirdness here is intrinsic to the Fabuland product line: it takes place in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry">Scarreyesque</a> village of anthropomorphic animals. But as we all know, overly-cheerful facades often harbor horrible secrets. (There are plenty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEC4389AD9D69F3D">more episodes</a> for those who want more.)</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.nifeislife.com/orzoro-soluble-120g-p-777.html">Nestlé Orzoro</a> Commercial (1985)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-ixHXylZ8?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>In this frenetic 15-second commercial, a pig and a panda pull back a curtain to reveal a forest. In the forest, six Fabulanders pop out of a tree and wave before disappearing again. But the forest was just another curtain! Some characters fly through the air to place logos! Another curtain! Oh look, it&#8217;s the product! How did the pig get trapped inside? No time to worry about that, he&#8217;s saved by a parrot on a trapeze! Another curtain, everybody bows! What was that commercial about?</p>
<h3>4) &#8220;Barney&#8217;s Cherry&#8221; by Thauka Kuki Team Entertainment (2012)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TjM9cEg2nbM?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Even after watching this film half a dozen times, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite &#8220;solved&#8221; it. This animation is very clearly a riddle on multiple levels. Firstly, there is the riddle presented via intertitles, which the viewer is given time to ponder before being presented with an answer. However, that answer doesn&#8217;t really satisfy, and it&#8217;s clear that there are visual clues throughout that point to the real solution (the very first titlescreen makes sure we know this).</p>
<p>But even after I figured out that (highlight to reveal spoilers) <span style="color: #ffffff;">Bonnie is cheating on Ed with Barney and actually wanted to free Barney, but was tricked by the statues watering the flowers</span>, I still don&#8217;t understand why the horses on the side of the screen turn into different animals at 0:47, why the characters spend so much time looking at the sword and cherry, or what random flashes of light are all about. But because the film is well animated and has a good score, I don&#8217;t mind revisiting it again and again.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning: the following films contain objectionable content</span></h2>
<h3>5) &#8220;A day in the life of&#8230;&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/complessogasparo?feature=watch">Complesso Gasparo</a> (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vRNJCcnNvEQ?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Following the advice of a real-life chihuahua, a Fabuland monkey breaks the shackles of his buttoned-down life. He then proceeds to break-dance everywhere, deface a wall with obscene graffiti, take off his head, and attack a pig on a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>6) &#8220;The Franky Job&#8221; by David M Pickett (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSApqbyCJM4?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Rather than review my own film, I&#8217;m going to quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>&#8216; Bricks in Motion <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/films/view/126/">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s essentially a noir private-eye film, but at its core is laced with hidden subtexts of racism and bigotry. The film is at times humorous, thought-provoking, and disturbing, mixed together in a blend that would seem abstract (and is for the most part), but seems to come together somehow at the end.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) &#8220;Fabuland&#8221; by Grégory Métay et Olivier Couëllant (2000)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OsZAu0Y_LBo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This is the quintessential Fabuland animation and deserves 10 times as many views as it has. It features the most fully realized busy Fabuland town, and music and voice acting that perfectly fit the style of the characters. There&#8217;s a lot to admire here from  an animation perspective; the swaying palm trees are my personal favorite. Despite not knowing French, I felt like I understood the story perfectly thanks to the great visual storytelling. But why did I put this as the weirdest animation? Let&#8217;s just say it takes some very surprising turns.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: &#8220;<a href="http://brickzone.net/fabuland_housewives.html">The Fabuland Housewives</a>&#8221; by Mark Larson</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" title="Fabuland Housewives by Mark Larson" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg 650w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-268x200.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Though not animated, this hilarious webcomic by Mark Larson is an impressive feat that must have taken countless hours to script, design, photograph, and code. Like the ABC show that inspired it, it is chock full of scandal, gruesome murders, and shocking twists. However, it&#8217;s also uproariously funny and well worth a read if you&#8217;ve got a few hours to kill.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Why are Fabuland animations so weird (or did I exaggerate how weird they are)? Are there any major works I missed?</p>

<p>The 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London may have ended last weekend, but you can relive the highlights in LEGO form, thanks to the Guardian&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;feature=plcp">Brick by Brick</a>&#8221; series of animations. While I am not a sports buff <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXEPnKSxGY&amp;feature=youtu.be">myself</a>, even I can appreciate the amount of work that went into creating these videos.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really interesting to me about &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; are the constraints under which it was produced. As outlined in the above behind-the-scenes video, nine animations were created by a small team in the span of two weeks. Because of <a href="http://kotaku.com/5933126/a-news-broadcast-reenacted-olympic-highlights-with-lego?tag=lego">broadcasting restrictions</a>, news organizations can&#8217;t in many cases show video footage of Olympics events, so these brick animations stand in for the video. Considered as a form of sports journalism, &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a delightful, creative solution to a frustrating problem. It&#8217;s also cool that brick animation has become so widely embraced that it gets casually integrated into the operations of a major news outlet.</p>
<p>However, when judged as examples of the brick animation form, these videos are less remarkable. The low frame rate (about 5 FPS by my eye) makes the animation look choppy, and a lot of time is killed showing still images. Again, this is understandable given the constraints, but still leaves little to recommend. Those interested in these animations only for the animation should stick to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzu-kb34ZYk&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">highlights video</a> or the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt5wB_xxyQ&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video">gymnastics video</a>.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports/videos">LEGO Sport Champions</a>,&#8221; one of the earliest examples of brick animation.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U9u57UOh1Sc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a series of play-by-play recreations of real-life sports events, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; presents whimsical takes on traditional sports that frequently break the laws of physics. For example, in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0kkgmPQgo&amp;feature=plcp">hockey short,</a> one of the players briefly turns into a snake, and the &#8220;winner&#8221; of the match is a dog from the audience. Rather than using minifigures, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; favors expressive, brick-built characters. While &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; features English narration to explain the action, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is voiceless, and features a strong score that responds to the action.</p>
<p>As an official series of animations commissioned by the LEGO group, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is one of the few brick animations that can safely be said to take place in LEGOLAND*. It&#8217;s a place where animals and inanimate objects have as much agency as people do (the scoreboard wins the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST-tGPrltG4&amp;feature=plcp">gymnastics</a> competition), and where everything can be easily taken apart and recombined (when two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Ln9hkXPlc&amp;feature=plcp">F1 racers</a> collide, their cars combine into a giant striped race car which they decide to co-pilot). I want to live there.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sports Champions&#8221; weightlifting video above is probably the one that comes closest to having a story. It follows a gorilla as it escapes from the circus and heads across town to investigate (and then compete in) a weight-lifting competition. In addition to giving a brief glimpse of some wonderful large scale town buildings, this video is chock-full of creative moments. For instance, when the two circus workers realize the gorilla has escaped, one of them turns into a dog to track its scent. The scenes in the massage room where the gorilla and masseur take turns molding each other into strange shapes are prime examples of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Exaggeration">exaggeration</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>All seven of the &#8220;Sport Champion&#8221; videos are must-sees (and it will only take about half an hour to watch them all). Like the best brick animations, there is so much going on that you will want to watch them multiple times. Enjoy!</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m using LEGOLAND here in an anachronistic sense to refer to the <a href="http://www.peeron.com/catalogs/1982/medium/1/">fictional universe</a> that LEGO characters exist in, as opposed to the real-life theme parks with the same name.</p>
