				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, LEGO released a series of videos with helpful tips for brickfilming. Oddly, this coincided with LEGO discontinuing their brickfilming apps.<span id="more-2496"></span></p>
<p><iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLRNbTEZ7dhL0sWb15Wq7UneGQjXz6RFPm" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The four Brick Tricks videos are well made; they mix live-action and stop-motion footage to clearly convey the information. I&#8217;m sure that beginning brickfilmers will find these tips helpful. In a weird coincidence, both Brick Tricks and <a href="http://setbump.com/book">our book</a> illustrate the concept of deleting unnecessary shots from a movie using the example of someone walking to/from the Palace Cinema set.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2501" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="466" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing-1024x682.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing-300x200.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing-768x512.jpg 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing-700x466.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/lab_story_editing.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2502" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM-1024x552.png" alt="" width="700" height="377" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM-1024x552.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM-300x162.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM-768x414.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM-700x378.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-05-at-12.01.17-PM.png 1594w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The video descriptions of the Brick Tricks videos encourage viewers to &#8220;create your own stop-motion videos by downloading the <a href="http://lego.build/CreatorApp">Creator App</a>.&#8221; However, the link leads to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/creator/apps/creatorisland">Creator Island app</a> (which is just a game with no stop-motion features) as opposed to the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/creator/videos/have-a-look-at-the-new-lego-creator-app-7f9a5a0b89b345abb674cfb654f9989d">LEGO Creator app</a>. According to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lego.creator.creator&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a> page for LEGO Creator, the app was last updated on December 12, 2016 (3 days before these videos launched on YouTube). It seems like the update was just to add a message that it is being discontinued.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2498" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot_20170105-112920-1024x576.png" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot_20170105-112920-1024x576.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot_20170105-112920-300x169.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot_20170105-112920-768x432.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screenshot_20170105-112920-700x394.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mourn the loss of the LEGO Creator app; it was around for less than a year. The bigger loss—which I uncovered while researching the LEGO Creator disappearance—is that LEGO appears to have discontinued the LEGO Movie Maker app as well, after providing it for free for 4 years. The LEGO Movie Maker app wasn&#8217;t perfect (its biggest limitation was that it was only available for iOS), but it was a really good app for beginning brickfilmers and I have been recommending it to people since it was first released.</p>
<p>My hope is that LEGO has removed these apps in preparation for launching a new cross-platform brickfilming app in conjunction with the LEGO Batman Movie next month—but that&#8217;s pure speculation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the biggest names in brickfilming are joining forces to make a documentary about LEGO filmmaking. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1497819042/bricks-in-motion-a-documentary-about-lego-filmmaki">Go support them on Kickstarter</a>.<span id="more-2183"></span></p>
<p>Oh, did you need more information than that?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1497819042/bricks-in-motion-a-documentary-about-lego-filmmaki"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2185" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bim.png" alt="bim" width="700" height="684" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bim.png 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bim-300x293.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Some of the rewards on this campaign are phenomenal values:</p>
<p><strong>$25</strong> gets you a HD digital copy of the finished documentary and the Bricks in Motion Collection, which features 2 hours of brickfilms by famous LEGO animators (including several of the writers of this blog).</p>
<p><strong>$100</strong> gets you a cameo in the film as a minifigure (+ the documentary and the BiM Collection).</p>
<p>For <strong>$250</strong> Philip Heinrich will compose a song about you (or or a friend or family member), set to a custom-made 30 second animated short film by producer and animator Nathan Wells. This is such an outrageous value that I feel like I&#8217;m stealing from them by backing at this level (sorry guys!).</p>
<p>In summary, go check out <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1497819042/bricks-in-motion-a-documentary-about-lego-filmmaki">their Kickstarter page</a> and consider donating.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qhbliUq0_r4&amp;feature=youtu.be" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qhbliUq0_r4&amp;feature=youtu.be" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350" /></object></p>
<p>A <a href="http://youtu.be/qhbliUq0_r4">&#8220;Save the Arctic&#8221; campaign video</a> from Greenpeace has been making the rounds, <a href="http://legoblockshell.org">calling on The LEGO Group to end its partnership</a> with multinational oil and gas company Shell.<span id="more-2142"></span></p>
<p>The video features a vast arctic landscape, where humans and wildlife are swallowed up by a gigantic amount of oil released by a brick-built Shell oil rig. The piece ends with a caption that reads &#8220;Shell is polluting our kids&#8217; imaginations&#8221;, and the whole affair is underscored by a haunting cover of <a href="http://youtu.be/StTqXEQ2l-Y">&#8220;Everything is Awesome&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>In some ways, this campaign is brilliant. Between <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-2014/">The LEGO Movie</a>, <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2014/05/beyond-the-brick-a-lego-brickumentary-2014/">the &#8220;Beyond the Brick&#8221; documentary</a>, and the usual promo releases from TLG, 2014 has squarely solidified LEGO video content into the zeitgeist. This production plays right into that &#8212; not only through the music, but with some well-designed builds, artfully composed shots, and sweeping camera work. (For the moment, let&#8217;s ignore the blatant inclusion of a <del>Mega Bloks</del> <a href="http://www.brickforge.com/">Brickforge</a> Halo figure, and <a href="http://citizenbrick.myshopify.com/collections/minifigs/products/dragon-sword-fighter-force-complete-series-plus-bonus-minifig">GoT-looking figs that may or may not be the ones from Citizen Brick</a>.)</p>
<p>As clean as the cinematography is, though, the actual message of the video feels a bit more muddled. I understand what the goal is: Greenpeace wants to convince LEGO to end its partnership with Shell. That&#8217;s the &#8220;what&#8221;. But the &#8220;why&#8221; of it all seems less clear; at least as far as this video and <a href="http://legoblockshell.org">the associated website</a> are concerned.</p>
<p>When I first heard about this online movement <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/01/greenpeace-lego-shell-partnership-toys-oil-arctic">a week ago</a>, my initial reaction was <em>&#8220;does TLG even still </em>make<em> Shell-branded sets?&#8221;</em> Apparently, the answer is yes. Here&#8217;s a bit of history on TLG&#8217;s partnership with Shell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shell-branded LEGO sets appeared <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/325-3/Shell-service-station">as early as 1966</a>.</li>
<li>According to <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/Shell">Brickipedia</a> (which could really use some better attribution), the majority of the Shell sets were not available in the US. It seems as though Shell-branded LEGO products only started appearing stateside in 1986.</li>
<li>Prior to 1986, TLG also released<a href="http://brickset.com/sets?query=Exxon"> a few Exxon-branded sets</a> in the US.</li>
<li>In 1992, <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/6594-1/Gas-Transit">Octan</a> began to replace Shell as the main (albeit fictional) gasoline brand of LEGO Town (and later, City) sets.</li>
<li>1999 saw the last of the <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Town/subtheme-Shell">official wide-release sets with Shell branding from TLG</a>.</li>
<li>The Shell logo continued to be prevalent in LEGO kits until <a href="http://brickset.com/sets/year-2012?query=ferrari">as recently as 2012</a>, due to <a href="http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/oils-lubricants/cars/shell-oils/shell-ferrari.html">the partnership between Shell and Ferrari</a>.</li>
<li>Additionally, <a href="http://www.shell.com/global/products-services/on-the-road/fuels/ferrari-model-lego-collection.html">LEGO products continue to be offered as exclusives at Shell stations</a> to this day, though they are not always available in all regions.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, none of this information is included in <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/Global/usa/planet3/html/STA_SW2014/index.html">the Greenpeace &#8220;Save the Arctic&#8221; website</a>. Nor is there much information about what Shell is doing, or documented evidence as to how the environment is being affected. And for what little content there actually is on the site, there&#8217;s basically no attribution or sources. (Although some digging did turn up <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/sites/files/gpuk/Lego%20Is%20keeping%20Bad%20Company.pdf">this PDF</a> that goes into a bit more detail.)</p>
<p>What we get instead as the main hub of this campaign is a weird, heavy-handed, confusing-to-navigate site that <span style="color: #222222;">approaches <a href="http://legoclick.com/">&#8220;LEGO CL!CK&#8221;</a> levels of poor web design. Selecting the &#8220;more information&#8221; button on the site continues the mixed messages: should readers be concerned about advertising&#8217;s influence on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh2sWSVRrmo">the children</a>, saving the Arctic, preventing global warming, or Shell&#8217;s use of licensing partners to distract from its other corporate ventures? It feels like Greenpeace wants folks to simultaneously think about all and none of these things, and instead get so riled up in a ball of knee-jerk emotion that they sign the petition without a second thought. </span></p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;d rather do some research and make well-informed decisions. Is Shell involved in some unsavory business practices?<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/04/shell-oil-safety-warnings-moved-drill-ship-us-coast-guard"> Seems like it.</a> Does a partnership with Shell fly in the face of<a href="http://aboutus.lego.com/en-us/sustainability"> TLG&#8217;s commitment to environmental responsibility</a>? Maybe. Should a petitioning crusade eschew sourced information and individual judgment in favor of reactionary tactics to make its voice heard? Probably not.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a footnote: My research here is by no means exhaustive. If you&#8217;ve got thoughts or facts to contribute, or articles to reference, feel free to post them in the comments below. This campaign has already seen coverage in <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/greenpeace-lambasts-lego-polluting-childrens-imaginations-shell-sponsorship-1455749">the International Business Times</a>, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryflynn/2014/07/08/everything-is-not-awesome-with-lego-and-shell-says-greenpeace/">Forbes</a>, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/greenpeace-takes-on-lego-over-shell-partnership-1.2695167">CBC News</a>, and elsewhere.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time<a href="http://youtu.be/CtQKcM48hnw"> LEGO video content has been utilized in the service of activism</a>, and I&#8217;m sure it won&#8217;t be the last.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 7/11/14:</strong> Looks like the video was pulled from YouTube due to a copyright claim from Warner Bros.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 7/14/14: </strong>The video is back up on YouTube, and currently has 4.2 million views.</p>

<p><span id="more-1612"></span><br />
Scientists at IBM made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSCX78-8-q0">stop-motion movie</a> by moving atoms and taking picture with a microscope. Now, if you think you have big clumsy fingers when you move your minifigure, think of those scientists who had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4QWwaweWA">move carbon monoxide molecules</a> (two atoms stacked on top of each other) to animate their movie.</p>
<p>I’m a teacher and I’m very proud when one of my students show me their very first brickfilm. LEGO bricks open them to the world of movie-making and computers. I think that this &#8220;small&#8221; movie can make some kids start loving science (as well as movie-making) and maybe change the world. LEGO bricks can make kids start loving sciences and arts… and science and arts have the power to make people better.</p>
<p>Enjoy !</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IxqKcetzWbo" height="360" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe><br />
My French is <em>très</em> rusty, but even without understanding the language (thankfully, there are English captions) I was impressed by the lip-synced characters in &#8220;<a href="http://youtu.be/IxqKcetzWbo">Tout le bloc en parle</a>&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MonsieurCaron">MonsieurCaron</a>. While there are an abundance of brick animations that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f848GaFNTc">add digital mouths to minifigs</a>, and a few that swap out physical minifig heads, it is very rare to see brick-built mouth animation. In fact, the only other examples I can think of are &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8vsIvU3AZY">Country Buildin&#8217;</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNUmIqxGIJo">Little Guys</a>&#8221; by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Paganomation">illustrious co-author</a> of this blog.</p>
<p>The influence of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; on &#8220;Tout le bloc en parle&#8221; is clear not only in the brick-built characters, but also in the use of forced perspective sets for the background. That doesn&#8217;t take anything away from MonsieurCaron&#8217;s considerable accomplishments here. The characters are well-designed and fluidly animated and I found the use of miniland scale (see chapter 4 of <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/01/unofficial-lego-builders-guide-2012/">The Unofficial Lego Builder&#8217;s Guide</a>) characters for the audience particularly inspired. I mention the clear heritage of &#8220;Country Buildin'&#8221; mostly because it&#8217;s a good excuse to promote the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ea5Ua_8LJZ0">two</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Bd9OVspMI">excellent</a> behind-the-scenes videos which show all that goes into to making an animation at this scale.</p>
<p>Also, vive les enseignants!</p>

<p>Seeing this Nyan Cat creation by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76190514@N06/">Mr.Attacki</a> that incorporates motors and other technical bits to bring it to life reminded me of another impressive creation in this vein by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NeXTSTORMING">NeXTSTORM</a>:</p>

<p>While this doesn&#8217;t fit the traditional definition of what we&#8217;d consider a brick animation (there&#8217;s no stop motion involved), it&#8217;s too cool not to share here. While there are a lot of fan creations that include motorized elements, this is the first I&#8217;ve seen that tells a complete story (albeit a short one). I&#8217;m sure the programming and design of this creation was just as complicated and time-consuming as any animation. </p>
<p>What other LEGO fan creations have you seen that incorporate motorized elements like this?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjM9cEg2nbM">Barney&#8217;s cherry</a>&#8221; in the Eurobricks <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showforum=120">Brick Flicks and Comics forum</a> last weekend, I started wondering why animations starring Fabuland characters are so frequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">Lynchian</a>. Considering Fabuland was originally marketed at children ages 4-8, there is an alarmingly high occurrence of hallucinatory imagery, adult language, and graphic violence in these animations. There aren&#8217;t many Fabuland animations to begin with, so this list could also be called &#8220;The 7 Best Fabuland Animations,&#8221; but ranking them in order of weirdness is a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>1) &#8220;Mein Herz [My Heart]&#8221; by Pawnshop Orchestra (2006)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oGoXydXBwCo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This music video is probably the most straightforward Fabuland animation out there. A cat and a goat are in love, but far apart. The goat overcomes distance and an octopus to be reunited with his true love. Short, sweet, and barely weird.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; by FilmFair (1987)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dGFFmcu6mTc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>&#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; was an officially licensed series to promote the Fabuland sets. However, rather than using actual Fabuland products, the characters are made of clay, allowing for a much greater range of expression. This series is standard kid show fare; each episode presents a small challenge that is overcome in a friendly manner. The only weirdness here is intrinsic to the Fabuland product line: it takes place in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry">Scarreyesque</a> village of anthropomorphic animals. But as we all know, overly-cheerful facades often harbor horrible secrets. (There are plenty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEC4389AD9D69F3D">more episodes</a> for those who want more.)</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.nifeislife.com/orzoro-soluble-120g-p-777.html">Nestlé Orzoro</a> Commercial (1985)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-ixHXylZ8?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>In this frenetic 15-second commercial, a pig and a panda pull back a curtain to reveal a forest. In the forest, six Fabulanders pop out of a tree and wave before disappearing again. But the forest was just another curtain! Some characters fly through the air to place logos! Another curtain! Oh look, it&#8217;s the product! How did the pig get trapped inside? No time to worry about that, he&#8217;s saved by a parrot on a trapeze! Another curtain, everybody bows! What was that commercial about?</p>
<h3>4) &#8220;Barney&#8217;s Cherry&#8221; by Thauka Kuki Team Entertainment (2012)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TjM9cEg2nbM?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Even after watching this film half a dozen times, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite &#8220;solved&#8221; it. This animation is very clearly a riddle on multiple levels. Firstly, there is the riddle presented via intertitles, which the viewer is given time to ponder before being presented with an answer. However, that answer doesn&#8217;t really satisfy, and it&#8217;s clear that there are visual clues throughout that point to the real solution (the very first titlescreen makes sure we know this).</p>
<p>But even after I figured out that (highlight to reveal spoilers) <span style="color: #ffffff;">Bonnie is cheating on Ed with Barney and actually wanted to free Barney, but was tricked by the statues watering the flowers</span>, I still don&#8217;t understand why the horses on the side of the screen turn into different animals at 0:47, why the characters spend so much time looking at the sword and cherry, or what random flashes of light are all about. But because the film is well animated and has a good score, I don&#8217;t mind revisiting it again and again.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning: the following films contain objectionable content</span></h2>
<h3>5) &#8220;A day in the life of&#8230;&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/complessogasparo?feature=watch">Complesso Gasparo</a> (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vRNJCcnNvEQ?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Following the advice of a real-life chihuahua, a Fabuland monkey breaks the shackles of his buttoned-down life. He then proceeds to break-dance everywhere, deface a wall with obscene graffiti, take off his head, and attack a pig on a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>6) &#8220;The Franky Job&#8221; by David M Pickett (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSApqbyCJM4?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Rather than review my own film, I&#8217;m going to quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>&#8216; Bricks in Motion <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/films/view/126/">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s essentially a noir private-eye film, but at its core is laced with hidden subtexts of racism and bigotry. The film is at times humorous, thought-provoking, and disturbing, mixed together in a blend that would seem abstract (and is for the most part), but seems to come together somehow at the end.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) &#8220;Fabuland&#8221; by Grégory Métay et Olivier Couëllant (2000)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OsZAu0Y_LBo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This is the quintessential Fabuland animation and deserves 10 times as many views as it has. It features the most fully realized busy Fabuland town, and music and voice acting that perfectly fit the style of the characters. There&#8217;s a lot to admire here from  an animation perspective; the swaying palm trees are my personal favorite. Despite not knowing French, I felt like I understood the story perfectly thanks to the great visual storytelling. But why did I put this as the weirdest animation? Let&#8217;s just say it takes some very surprising turns.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: &#8220;<a href="http://brickzone.net/fabuland_housewives.html">The Fabuland Housewives</a>&#8221; by Mark Larson</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" title="Fabuland Housewives by Mark Larson" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg 650w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-268x200.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Though not animated, this hilarious webcomic by Mark Larson is an impressive feat that must have taken countless hours to script, design, photograph, and code. Like the ABC show that inspired it, it is chock full of scandal, gruesome murders, and shocking twists. However, it&#8217;s also uproariously funny and well worth a read if you&#8217;ve got a few hours to kill.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Why are Fabuland animations so weird (or did I exaggerate how weird they are)? Are there any major works I missed?</p>

<p>I think most LEGO fans are familiar with the story of Ole Kirk Christiansen, and how The LEGO Group originally developed from his small woodworking company in the early-mid 20th century. It&#8217;s been well-documented in a number of official books, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Lego-Book-Modellers/dp/0751359483/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897520&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+ultimate+lego+book">this one</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Years-LEGO-Brick-Christian-Humberg/dp/3898808874/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897635&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lego+50+year">this one</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Book-Daniel-Lipkowitz/dp/0756666937/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344897556&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+lego+book">this one</a>.</p>
<p>But now this history is available in a new format &#8212; last Friday marked the 80th anniversary of The LEGO Group, and to honor the occasion, they released <a href="http://youtu.be/NdDU_BBJW9Y">a short film</a> detailing the company&#8217;s evolution. While it is an animated film, it&#8217;s neither stop-motion nor LEGO animation, so I won&#8217;t be approaching it with all of the review aspects we&#8217;d normally cover on this site. But I did want to talk about it, because&#8230; it&#8217;s a long, drawn-out mess.</p>
<p>From the get-go, there&#8217;s something oddly disorienting about the way &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; is told. We start by fading from a (CGI) LEGO-brick-built edifice to a real (CGI) building, as we move back in time to Billund, Denmark in 1932. The pleasant voice-over narration tells us that we are following Ole Kirk Christiansen&#8217;s story; and, as a man exits the building on-screen, we assume this must be Ole himself.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s one of his workers, and about 15 seconds pass before we realize this and meet the real Ole. Huh?</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-235 alignright" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Ole" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Ole" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-910x1024.jpg" width="700" height="787" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-910x1024.jpg 910w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-266x300.jpg 266w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01-700x787.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_01.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>The story continues, and there&#8217;s a match cut between the worker exiting and Ole sitting down with his wife, further confusing the two characters (and the audience). Ole laments his work situation, and his wife tries to cheer him up with some dialogue that adds absolutely nothing to the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s hard to understand. But at least now&#8230; it can&#8217;t get much worse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Time passes with another dissolve, and the lighthearted narrator informs us &#8220;it did get worse!&#8221; &#8212; Ole&#8217;s wife, a character who had a total screen time of 15 seconds, is now dead. The above quote is her only dialogue in the film. So much for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekov%27s_gun">Chekhov&#8217;s Gun.</a></p>
<p>(Admittedly, I can&#8217;t really summarize it better than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?threaded=1&amp;v=NdDU_BBJW9Y&amp;page=2">YouTube commenter Evan Buchholz</a>: &#8220;Jesus, that was the most cheery &#8216;but it did get worse&#8217; I ever heard.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Thus, in the first one-and-a-half minutes, we&#8217;re already introduced to the three major issues with the entire film:</p>
<ol>
<li>Narration that doesn&#8217;t match the tone of the story</li>
<li>Confusing shot composition and blocking</li>
<li>Dialogue that restates information we&#8217;ve already gotten from the picture and narration</li>
</ol>
<p>And we still have around 14 minutes left to sit through.</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought maybe this film had been translated into English from another language. LEGO is a Danish company, after all, and a multinational brand. But the lip sync here seems to match the dialogue, and the credits list the &#8220;Original Voice Cast&#8221;; so I&#8217;ll assume &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; was created in English first.</p>
<p>The majority of TLG&#8217;s animated releases &#8212; save for <a href="http://www.brickset.com/search/?query=dvd">the direct-to-DVD films</a> &#8212; are either silent or have voice-over, which I believe serves to make them more universal. (Out of all <a href="http://www.paganomation.com/work/commissioned/">the work we&#8217;ve done for TLG at Paganomation</a>, not one film has been dialogue-based.) Strangely enough, the next minute or so of the film follows this approach pretty well. There&#8217;s some nice <del>animation</del> motion capture of Ole interacting with his sons, and the development of <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Duck">the classic LEGO duck.</a></p>
<p>But as soon as the &#8220;Wholesaler&#8221; character arrives, we&#8217;re back to clunky dialogue. &#8220;Now there&#8217;s finally someone who can see the opportunities in what we&#8217;re doing!&#8221; Thank you, we know; we just saw that.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-237" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Wholesaler" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; Wholesaler" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-1024x576.jpg" width="700" height="393" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02-700x393.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_02.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>These bizarre inconsistencies continue throughout the film; again, most prominently in the voice-over. Even though we see the company&#8217;s ups and downs as the years pass, the narrator never wavers from his chipper delivery of exposition. I attribute this to what&#8217;s sometimes known as &#8220;LEGO humor&#8221; &#8212; the sense given through TLG&#8217;s cinematic releases that everything is whimsical and fun, even when the information being presented clearly contradicts this idea.</p>
<p>The most bewildering moment of narration comes <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdDU_BBJW9Y&amp;t=09m45s">at around the 10 minute mark</a>; when, out of nowhere, the narrator says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Everyone thought that was a good idea, and we were placed on the sofa, with all the presents and flowers around us!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wait&#8230; &#8220;we&#8221;?! Who&#8217;s &#8220;we&#8221;? Up until this point, the narrative style has been <em>third-person omniscient;</em> with the voice-over recounting the story, in retrospect, from outside the world the film takes place in. Now, all of a sudden, we&#8217;re hearing a <em>first-person</em> account? Who is talking? I literally rewound to the beginning of the film, just to make sure I hadn&#8217;t missed some important introduction. I hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And then, once again, this left-field change is immediately disregarded, and it&#8217;s another minute of run-time before we hear the narrator refer to himself as &#8220;I&#8221; again. Eventually, the ending of the film suggests the narrator is Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen &#8212; I say &#8220;suggests&#8221; because we never hear his name, and he never introduces himself to the audience.</p>
<p>This is the overall problem with &#8220;The LEGO® Story&#8221; &#8212; it pays no attention to <em>the language of film;</em> the rules that have developed over time so that audiences can clearly follow a story. You can twist and bend these rules to do some interesting things, but when you blatantly ignore them, your film starts to get weird.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to tell a story from a first-person perspective, introduce the storyteller from the beginning, so that we know who&#8217;s talking to us. If you&#8217;re going to have dialogue, make sure that it serves a purpose; otherwise, cut it out entirely. Make sure you&#8217;re clear on the tone of your film &#8212; tone, <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/plinkett/">as Plinkett reminds us</a>, is how a film <em>feels</em>. Either make a film that&#8217;s entirely upbeat, and excise the depressing historical bits; or, tell a story that flows naturally from happy to sad, and have the rest of the film&#8217;s elements match and support that.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04.jpg"><img class="alignright size-large wp-image-239" title="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; guy" alt="&quot;The LEGO® Story&quot; guy" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-1024x576.jpg" width="700" height="393" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04-700x393.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/LEGOstory_04.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, have an idea of who your audience is &#8212; who you&#8217;re making your film <em>for</em>. The &#8220;LEGO humor&#8221; concept I mentioned above is a way to have films appeal directly to KFOLs; the target LEGO demographic. The confusing, slipshod way this film is made negates that idea; culminating with the narrator discussing &#8220;children&#8221; at the film&#8217;s finale, as if no children were watching.</p>
<p>Which, after 15+ minutes, I can&#8217;t say I really blame them. This film could have been half the running time and told the same story more effectively. &#8220;Only the Best is Good Enough&#8221;? Eh, maybe next time.</p>
