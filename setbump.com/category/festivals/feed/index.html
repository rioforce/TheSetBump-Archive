				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are proud to announce the winners of the 2017 <a href="http://brickworld.com">Brickworld Chicago</a> Film Festival! <span id="more-2711"></span><br />
<a href="http://setbump.com/2017/04/submit-to-the-2017-brickworld-film-festival/">As previously mentioned</a>, this is the first year that we opened it up to entrants from across the globe, and it showed—we received 34 eligible entries; a record number for our festival!</p>
<p>The winners were voted on by an audience of ~100 Brickworld registered attendees. Without further ado, here are the winning entries:</p>
<p>Best Film (by a Brickworld Chicago attendee): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVdC8ZYNJzQ">&#8220;Sale of a Lifetime&#8221; by Casey McCoy</a></p>

<p>Best Film (International): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-q34uA9CJA">&#8220;The Adventures of Kentucky Jackson&#8221; by Kris Theorin</a></p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O-q34uA9CJA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVnaqd9Uvnk&#038;list=PLq3FRoCQQNRBWcplsIaFgfcHNm4pGcXNk&#038;index=17">&#8220;Full Time Job&#8221; by Tyler Eyerly</a> placed 2nd and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRBWcplsIaFgfcHNm4pGcXNk&#038;v=E4b68UAVf4E">&#8220;A Horse&#8217;s Tale&#8221; by Gregory &#038; Garry Moore</a> came in 3rd in the international voting.</p>
<p>All the eligible festival entries were screened in a continuous loop for the 8000+ attendees of the Brickworld Chicago exposition on Saturday June 17 and Sunday June 18. We also presented a special screening of <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/movie/">&#8220;Bricks in Motion&#8221;</a> (the North American premiere!) to registered attendees.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our winners, and a big thank you to everyone who submitted a film! You can check out all of the submitted films via the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRBWcplsIaFgfcHNm4pGcXNk">playlist</a>. Enjoy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re very excited to announce the sixth annual Brickworld Film Festival! The event theme for <a href="http://brickworld.com/brickworld-chicago/">Brickworld Chicago 2017</a> is &#8220;Lights, Camera, Bricks!&#8221;, so we&#8217;re opening up the film festival to filmmakers from all over the world for the first time ever.<span id="more-2660"></span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2682 size-full" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Film-Festival.png" alt="Brickworld Film Fest logo" width="1024" height="296" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Film-Festival.png 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Film-Festival-300x87.png 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Film-Festival-768x222.png 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Film-Festival-700x202.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>We want this to be the best brickfilm festival ever, so we have very few eligibility requirements (see the official rules below). Your film doesn&#8217;t have to be recently made or contain any specific theme. We want your best work <strong>of all time</strong>. All eligible films will screen continuously in the Brickfilm Theater for the duration of Brickworld Chicago. The attendees of Brickworld Chicago will vote on the films to decide the winners. We&#8217;ve also pulled together a pretty awesome prize pack for the winner.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2677" src="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/prizes-1024x453.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="310" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/prizes-1024x453.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/prizes-300x133.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/prizes-768x340.jpg 768w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/prizes-700x310.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>And while attending Brickworld Chicago isn&#8217;t required to enter the contest, we highly recommend it. In addition to the film festival, we will be running a LEGO animation workshop, screening a special film, showcasing models from our latest animations and just generally hanging out and talking about LEGO.

<p>This year&#8217;s &#8220;BrickFlix Lite&#8221; screening will be part of <a href="http://brickmagic.org/">BrickMagic 2015</a>, in Concord, North Carolina. The bad news? The screening won&#8217;t be in a movie theater, as it has been in past years. The good news? The restrictions on films with licensed characters are relaxed, so you can finally submit those epic fan films you&#8217;ve been sitting on.

<p><a href="http://www.bricksbythebay.com/">Bricks by the Bay</a> is the latest LEGO fan event to add a brickfilming component to their schedule. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I&#8217;m involved with this one, too (though only as a judge).</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="first-para" style="color: #000000;">Show off your LEGO animation skills at the Bricks by the Bay Brickfilm Festival. Create a film that exemplifies the convention theme, or send us your most recent stop-motion masterpiece, and it might be part of a screening for convention attendees.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Winners in the following categories will be announced during the Bricks by the Bay Convention awards ceremony, and will receive a brick-built trophy and a LEGO set:</p>
<ul style="color: #000000;">
<li>Best Film</li>
<li>Best Film in the convention theme (2104: “Fun &amp; Games”)</li>
<li>Best Story</li>
<li>Best Technical Achievement</li>

<p>We&#8217;re very excited to announce the third annual Brickworld Film Festival!</p>
<p><span id="more-1947"></span></p>
<p>The Brickworld Film Festival is part of <a style="font-size: 15px;" href="http://www.brickworld.us/chicago/">Brickworld Chicago</a>, one of the largest conventions of LEGO fans in the world. <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/06/results-of-the-2013-brickworld-film-festival/">Last year</a>, we invited attendees to submit their brick animations (or live-action brick flicks) and screened the 8 <a style="font-size: 15px;" href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRC7toJD_QWVtPpP28RDzB3_">entries</a> (spanning a variety of genres and styles, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE7Hwma3pE">a live-action comedy sketch</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkwqEQ6fjU">a pulp-style space adventure</a>) to an enthusiastic audience of over 160 people.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1230" alt="audience watching a projection screen" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg" width="700" height="333" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>The event theme for Brickworld Chicago 2014 is &#8220;Candy, Sweet Escapes,&#8221; so we&#8217;re asking this year&#8217;s entrants to keep this concept in mind when creating/selecting their submissions. We expect to see some films featuring the <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Ice-Cream-Machine-70804">Ice Cream Machine</a> and <a href="http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Downtown-Bakery-41006?fromListing=listing">Downtown Bakery</a>. However, we&#8217;re also hoping to see other creative approaches to the theme; for instance, last year&#8217;s winning film, &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1ncWyr-4AU">From Baking to Bad Guys</a>,&#8221; could easily fit in this year&#8217;s theme.</p>
<p>Like last year, David and David will carefully review all the entrants, and select the best one to declare the winner.  Additionally, an &#8216;Audience Favorite&#8217; will be voted on during the festival screening.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1233" alt="Five guys standing on a stage smiling" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-1024x768.jpg" width="700" height="525" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-268x200.jpg 268w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/9077082035_241857cca1_k-700x525.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>For those of you on the fence about attending Brickworld Chicago, keep in mind there&#8217;s more to the event than just the film festival. On Thursday, we&#8217;ll be teaching a three-hour workshop on brick animation, which covers basic techniques and includes some hands-on animation time. There are also displays, workshops, presentations, contests, games, and a ton of LEGO bric-a-brac to keep your attention.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2013 is nearing an end and many of the world&#8217;s brickfilmers will have some time off from school or work and hopefully be making a few brickfilms during their holiday break.  If there are any brickfilmers looking to enter some contests, we have a great selection below.</p>
<p><span id="more-1723"></span></p>
<p>One can choose between five notable brickfilming contests with deadlines between Christmas morning and the end of year.  Two of the competitions do not even require that the brickfilm be made special for that particular contest, just as long as it was made in 2013.  All of the contests have prizes. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Ii3HX0v.png" width="640" height="166" /><a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/">BricksInMotion.com</a> will be holding their annual <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/18082/thac-11-is-on-the-way/">Twenty-four Hour Animation Contest</a> just a few days before the end of the year. <a href="//www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/18082/thac-11-is-on-the-way/"> THAC11</a> will start at<b> 12pm GMT on Saturday December 28th, 2013</b>. Brickfilmers that enter a THAC do all the idea-making, writing, recording, animating, editing and submitting in just one twenty-four hour period.  It can be quite a grueling process.  At the start time of the contest, details about THAC will be announced on BIM that will include the theme and mod elements.  Although BIM has a few other official contests, I tend to view THAC as their most prestigious contest.  Some notable past winners are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SmeagolStudios">Sméagol</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander">Legoander</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ForlornCreature">ForlornCreature</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SpastikChuwawa">SpastikChuwawa</a>. The contest does have prizes from its sponsor <a href="//www.brickworld.us/">Brickworld</a>.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Zoot101">Hazzat (Zoot Productions)</a> is administering the contest announcement thread on BIM.  Let&#8217;s hope for an on time start this year as there has been issues with that in the past.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.repellingspider.com/p/home.html">A Repelling Spider</a> is hosting another installment of <a href="http://www.bricksinmotion.com/forums/topic/18131/christmas-in-a-minute-2013-open/">Christmas in a Minute</a>.  The goal of the contest is to make a 20-60 second Christmas themed brickfilm that <strong><em>&#8220;can stand out and claim a victory&#8221;</em></strong>.  There are prizes for the winners which were provided by contest sponsors <a href="http://firestartoys.com/">Firestar Toys</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MightyWanderer1">Mighty Wanderer</a>. The deadline is <b>Christmas Eve, Tuesday December 24, 2013 at 11:59pm EST.  </b>For more information about this great contest, watch the announcement video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBBbXzpoHI4&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>

<p>Members of the French brickfiming website <a href="http://www.brick-a-brack.com">Brick-à-Brack</a> can enter <a href="http://www.brick-a-brack.com/brickstars/">Brickstars</a>.  Brick-à-Brack hosts their big annual brickfilm contest at the end of the year.  Any film released in the year 2013 is eligible for this contest.  Entries will be judged in several different categories such as Best Soundtrack, Best Production Design, Best Special Effects, Best Screenplay, Best Animation, and Best Brickfilmer. Other awards will also be given out for &#8220;Most Promising Video&#8221; and &#8220;Audience Award&#8221; that is voted on by Brick-à-Brack members.  Past winners have included great brickfilmers such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FranceetAlex">France &amp; Alex</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Legoander">Legoander</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqqJkJAL0BIItXKWaxaWr1w">Aiwha</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/lgfb1film">Loïc F-B</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://brickfilmersguild.com/elgg/pg/photos/download/25387/inline/" width="800" height="216" /> A sports themed brickfilming contest called <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com/elgg/pg/blog/read/25388/oyo-video-challenge-ii-hosted-by-thefourmonkeys"><strong>OYO Video Challege II</strong></a> is being hosted and judged by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefourmonkeys4">thefourmonkeys</a>.  <a href="http://www.oyosportstoys.com/">OYO Sportstoys</a> is sponsoring the contest and providing prizes. OYO Sportstoys make LEGO compatible minfigures for NFL and Major League Baseball teams. The deadline is <b> December 31st at 9pm EST</b>.  The rules are posted on a blog by <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com/elgg/pg/blog/read/25388/oyo-video-challenge-ii-hosted-by-thefourmonkeys">thefourmonkeys</a> on the <a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com/">Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild</a>. You can also checkout the announcement video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaC00OA5HXE">here</a>. The main directive for the contest is to show an OYO Sportstoys minifigure(s) in action.  The deadline has passed for the free OYO minifigure, but prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place winners.  <i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/bigbudlego?feature=watch">BigBudLego</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PritchardStudios">PritchardStudios</a> placed 1st and 2nd last year.</i></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://brickfilmersguild.com/elgg/pg/photos/download/25410/inline/" width="479" height="93" /><a href="http://brickfilmersguild.com/">The Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild</a> is also back with the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaZzv7nSNig">2013 Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild Animation Festival</a>.  The Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild Animation Festival is the annual animation festival hosted on the Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild and judged by thefourmonkeys and members of the Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild (Member&#8217;s Choice). The festival is in its sophomore year and has slightly tweaked rules from last year. Only one brickfilm per person is allowed and there is a 10 minute time limit for the brickfilms. The festival is open to any brickfilmer including non-Brickfilmer&#8217;s Guild members. Honors will be mentioned for many categories and there will be a prize for <strong>Best Brickfilm</strong>.  Last year, the Best Brickfilm went to the amazing brickfilmer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/namchild?feature=watch">namchild</a> for his outstanding brickfilm entitled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5hfcJ4rWCU">The Duel (LEGO)</a>.</p>
<p>I was hoping to report about a sixth brickfilming contest, but it appears that Megabloks Toymation will not have a 2013 edition.  That&#8217;s too bad as the past winners have had some really great entries.</p>
<p>Happy competing!</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve never mentioned <a href="http://www.brickflix.org">The BrickFlix Film Festival</a> before! It&#8217;s not like <a href="http://brickflix.org/about/">I co-run it</a> or anything. <span id="more-174"></span></p>
<p>BrickFlix is a yearly screening held in Durham, NC at <a href="http://www.carolinatheatre.org/">The Carolina Theatre</a>. It started in 2010 as part of the <a href="http://brickmagic.org/">BrickMagic LEGO fan festival</a>, but has since branched off into it&#8217;s own event. As far as I know, it&#8217;s the only yearly screening in North America that showcases brick animation and other LEGO fan films in a real theater. And after each screening, there&#8217;s a Q&amp;A session where directors are invited to answer questions and talk about their films.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1249" alt="BrickFlix 2013 Panel" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSC05255.jpg" width="1185" height="656" /></p>
<p>BrickFlix 2013 took place last week and, in addition to the 122 audience attendees, also saw our largest Q&amp;A panel ever! Directors from <a href="http://aquamorphproductions.com/">Aquamorph Productions</a>, <a href="http://animatostudios.blogspot.com/">Animato Studios</a>, <a href="http://sonjiracentral.webs.com/">Sonjira Central</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/AnnoyingNoisesInc">Annoying Noises Productions</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/KeeponBrickin">Lucasetak J</a> were all on hand to explain their inspirations, accomplishments, and techniques.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still waiting on confirmation for BrickFlix 2014, but as soon as we have a date, we&#8217;ll open it up for submissions. Rest assured that when the date is confirmed, I&#8217;ll let you know here. In the meantime, enjoy <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxM0CTu_Y8w&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLeILYO3dehS8xTH9EfZvajECJrIOz0P5m">this year&#8217;s playlist!</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month we had the privilege of running the <a title="Enter the Second Annual Brickworld Film Festival!" href="http://brickanimation.com/2013/02/enter-the-second-annual-brickworld-film-festival/">2nd Annual Brickworld Film Festival</a>. We had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRC7toJD_QWVtPpP28RDzB3_">eight great entries</a> spanning a variety of genres and styles, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcE7Hwma3pE">a live-action comedy sketch</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fkwqEQ6fjU">a pulp-style space adventure</a>. Over 160 people showed up to watch and vote on the films.<span id="more-1228"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1230" alt="audience watching a projection screen" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg" width="700" height="333" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience.jpg 700w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/audience-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;re grateful to all the Lego filmmakers who dedicated hours to making these films. We know how much work and courage it takes to make a film and show it to a crowd of strangers. Without them, there wouldn&#8217;t have been a festival.</p>
<p>This year we gave out two trophies. The &#8220;Most Popular Film&#8221; trophy went to Paul Vermeesch (and friends) for &#8220;Nottingham Tower.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/fDIV9p6CArY" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDIV9p6CArY">Nottingham Tower</a>&#8221; was easily the most technically impressive and ambitious film in the festival. It features smooth animation, fast-paced fight choreography, and impressive camera movements. We were quite pleased to see it win the popular vote; it was richly deserved.</p>

<p>The second trophy went to the film that David and I agreed on as being the most well-rounded. We looked for a film that balanced story-telling, creativity, humor, and technical skill while also fitting into the Brickworld 2013 theme of Heroes and Villains. The winner of &#8220;Best Film&#8221; was &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1ncWyr-4AU">From Baking to Bad Guys</a>&#8221; by Caleb Schilling.</p>

<p>We felt that of all the films submitted, this one did the best job of giving the audience an understanding of the protagonist&#8217;s motivations. The protagonist has a clear goal (become a real fire fighter), faces challenges along the way (he is better at cooking than fighting fires), but ultimately triumphs. The film also did an excellent job of setting a mood through the lighting and music, and it featured interesting animation throughout (the opening city shot and the cake baking sequence are my favorites).</p>

<p>After we finished the main festival screening, we showed some of our favorite brick animations that we&#8217;ve highlighted on this blog in the past year. You can see the playlist we screened <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq3FRoCQQNRAbAqilEBtDtvcefiPO7FXk">here</a>. Thanks to every one who came out for the festival! We hope to see even more people there next year.</p>
<p>P.S. On Thursday of Brickworld we taught a 3-hour workshop on LEGO Animation. We took that opportunity to publicly unveil the Set Bump Logo for the first time. Here&#8217;s a photo of that which is 100% candid and not at all staged:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://miff.machinimainteractivefilmfestival.com">The Machinima Interactive Film Festival</a> hosted a video contest recently; and, as with many online video contests, there were a few LEGO-animated entries amongst the ranks&#8230;<span id="more-796"></span></p>
<hr />

<p>First up, in the ACTION/DRAMA ANIMATION category, is &#8220;LEGO Portal 2 Part 1/2&#8221; by Kooberz Studios. Director Alex Kobbs has made a name for himself creating LEGO versions of popular video game properties (you can check out more on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/Kooberz">his YouTube channel</a>), so in many ways, this contest was tailor-made for his work. There are a few neat animation techniques in the video, but what I was most impressed with was the sets &#8212; some really cool, detailed renditions of Portal 2 environments and backgrounds, and a ball-jointed GLaDOS that works really well.</p>
<p>(Full disclosure: I&#8217;ve only played through Portal 1, though 2 is sitting on my shelf, waiting for a day when I actually have some free time.)</p>
<p>Of course, like many LEGO-animated video game adaptations, there&#8217;s not much in the way of story here. This video is billed as a part 1 of 2, and I honestly can&#8217;t imagine what part 2 would be apart from more of the same. The video plays out like a clips show of game scenes, presented in a sort of Robot Chicken-esque channel surfing format. If you&#8217;ve never played any of the Portal games (or Half-Life, which I am assuming is where those characters who show up at the end are from), there may not be as much for you here, apart from some cool MOCs and animation bits. There&#8217;s also <a href="http://youtu.be/LE2_36xExKo">a behind-the-scenes video</a>, which is something I always love seeing from other artists.</p>
<hr />
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xtUSteNQOpw" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Next we have an entry from The Four Monkeys: a pretty faithful recreation of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkkoHAzjnUs">the Grand Theft Auto 5 trailer</a>. The audio in their video comes directly from the real trailer; and with it, a storyline for the game told in voice over. Again, we have some really great set pieces that are pretty well matched to the trailer they come from.</p>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-834" title="4monkeys_gta5" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-300x168.jpg" width="300" height="168" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-300x168.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/4monkeys_gta5-700x393.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>I was also really impressed by a few particular moments &#8212; the shot of the guy on the jetski, the microscale city shot at 0:49, and the driving scene at 1:00. There&#8217;s a surprising amount of chroma keying, but it works and isn&#8217;t distracting. This is a solid piece, with as solid of a storyline as the source material allows. (I know I keep bringing up storylines; more on that in a moment.)</p>

<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9WflM7m343k" height="315" width="560" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s &#8220;LEGO The Battle of Helm&#8217;s Deep&#8221;, a Lord of the Rings-themed sketch from Brotherhood Workshop (whom we&#8217;ve mentioned <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/wi-fi-uruk-hai/">once</a> or <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/11/keep-it-secret-keep-it-safe/">twice</a> before). The film has some really nice lighting and shot composition, sweet battle scenes (check out those crowds of warriors!), and consistently well-animated minifigs. Again, I&#8217;m not terribly familiar with the source material, but I know enough to say that Legolas is the star here, and his skidding-into-frame and &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the boooooox&#8221; animation are my favorite parts of this short. I assume the &#8220;get you a box to stand on&#8221; bit comes from one of the movies, and while I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s enough for 2-and-a-half minutes of story, it is a great excuse for some LotR homage action.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, the entries here are heavy on visuals and light on story; perhaps appropriate for what I&#8217;m assuming was a video game themed contest (admittedly I&#8217;m still a bit confused as to how LotR fits into that). It looks like voting took place on Twitter and ended December 8th, so we should be seeing the winners soon!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of these properties, I definitely recommend giving these entries a watch. If not, there&#8217;s at least some cool brick animation to check out!</p>
