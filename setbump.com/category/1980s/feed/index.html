				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sports brickfilms are a unique genre of brickfilms. Â Most have no story, aside from <a href="http://brickanimation.com/2012/08/olympic-lego-then-and-now/">recreating an actual sporting moment</a>, no characters other than famous athletes with personalities, and little to no dialogue.Â <span id="more-1954"></span>The genre of sporting brickfilms has some popularity and the dozen on this list have over 14 million views.Â Many find their popularity from the brickfilming community, the general YouTube audience, the online sporting community, or just being in blogged by the countless online news groups.</p>
<p>I researched a bit today on the ole&#8217; internet for some examples of sporting brickfilms and I found ten videos plus two of our own creations that we made recently. Â So&#8230;&#8230;I present &#8220;A Dozen Sports Brickfilms&#8221; in order based of the current number views.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/GYgf7R1M5u4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYgf7R1M5u4">Seattle Seahawks Win OYO Super Bowl XLVIII!</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefourmonkeys4">thefourmonkeys</a> was released on the Sports Illustrated Kids <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sikidsdotcom">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">website</a>. Â It recreates the most recent Super Bowl with OYO Sportstoys minifigures. Â It&#8217;s the newest of the dozen brickfilms.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/G91fjqRoHsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G91fjqRoHsQ">LEGO Snowboarding Tricks &#8211; Brickfilm (HD)</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/FilmsByDan">Plastic Planet Productions</a> is a beautiful take on snowboarding done brick style. Â It has very smooth animations and is quite a fun watch.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/zCjL5Vr5Q5s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCjL5Vr5Q5s">The Red Sox World Series Victory, in OYOs!</a>Â byÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thefourmonkeys4">thefourmonkeys</a>Â was also released on the Sports Illustrated KidsÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/sikidsdotcom">YouTube channel</a>Â andÂ <a href="http://www.sikids.com/">website</a>. Â It was released just shortly after the completion of the 2013 World Series and enjoyed a small viral affect due to the blogging and tweeting about it. Of the 1/2 dozen sports brickfilms that thefourmonkeys made for SIKids, this one is the most popular. The sporting fans loved the beard tug and helmet adjustment.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/oiHWtHAjX7E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiHWtHAjX7E">Lego Freeskiing: Deep Pow</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Googl295">Oxburger</a> Studios. Â I found this film for the first time today. Wow!! The cinematography, lighting, and scenic elements draw you into this awesome snow skiing adventure.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fv0kkgmPQgo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0kkgmPQgo">Lego Sport Champions: Hockey</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a>Â The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a> channel looks pretty dormant these days, but they left us with someÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports/videos">great sports brickfilms</a>. Although the equipment they used to make their films is fairly antiquated, their brickfilms stand the test of time and are well worth the watch. Â They also used no minifigures which makes them special just for that fact.</p>
<p><iframe width="480" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/v8Ln9hkXPlc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Ln9hkXPlc">Lego Sport Champions: F1 Racing</a> by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports">LEGOsports</a>Â This F1 car race is a super exciting thrill ride at high speeds.</p>

Â Pure football (soccer) excitement. Â The stop motion is not incredibly smooth, but the use of the original announcer audio pulls you into an exciting brickfilm.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-Jm3JhG-JtU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Jm3JhG-JtU">5 Greatest NBA Finals Moments Legoized</a> byÂ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/tauntrtv">tauntrtv</a> recreates plays from basketball championship games. Â It&#8217;s a well produced video with decent stopmotion that has me remembering the old NBA days. I&#8217;m not a big fan of basketball, but you don&#8217;t have to be in order to enjoy this.Â Ahhhh, the days of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKLMBZa3fSg">Brick by Brick: Running: Usain Bolt wins gold in 100m final</a> by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuardian">Guardian</a>. Â The video was produced by the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us">Guardian</a> (an online news group) and they have also released a dozen or so brickfilm sports recreations.Â The animation is a little choppy, but the sets are really good and you get a great feel for the energy of the events recreated. Â I really liked the water in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYUFNUWY-2U">Michael Phelps video</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After seeing &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjM9cEg2nbM">Barney&#8217;s cherry</a>&#8221; in the Eurobricks <a href="http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?showforum=120">Brick Flicks and Comics forum</a> last weekend, I started wondering why animations starring Fabuland characters are so frequently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch">Lynchian</a>. Considering Fabuland was originally marketed at children ages 4-8, there is an alarmingly high occurrence of hallucinatory imagery, adult language, and graphic violence in these animations. There aren&#8217;t many Fabuland animations to begin with, so this list could also be called &#8220;The 7 Best Fabuland Animations,&#8221; but ranking them in order of weirdness is a lot more fun.</p>
<h3>1) &#8220;Mein Herz [My Heart]&#8221; by Pawnshop Orchestra (2006)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/oGoXydXBwCo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This music video is probably the most straightforward Fabuland animation out there. A cat and a goat are in love, but far apart. The goat overcomes distance and an octopus to be reunited with his true love. Short, sweet, and barely weird.</p>
<h3>2) &#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; by FilmFair (1987)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dGFFmcu6mTc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>&#8220;Edward and Friends&#8221; was an officially licensed series to promote the Fabuland sets. However, rather than using actual Fabuland products, the characters are made of clay, allowing for a much greater range of expression. This series is standard kid show fare; each episode presents a small challenge that is overcome in a friendly manner. The only weirdness here is intrinsic to the Fabuland product line: it takes place in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scarry">Scarreyesque</a> village of anthropomorphic animals. But as we all know, overly-cheerful facades often harbor horrible secrets. (There are plenty <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDEC4389AD9D69F3D">more episodes</a> for those who want more.)</p>
<h3>3) <a href="http://www.nifeislife.com/orzoro-soluble-120g-p-777.html">NestlÃ© Orzoro</a> Commercial (1985)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/mK-ixHXylZ8?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>In this frenetic 15-second commercial, a pig and a panda pull back a curtain to reveal a forest. In the forest, six Fabulanders pop out of a tree and wave before disappearing again. But the forest was just another curtain! Some characters fly through the air to place logos! Another curtain! Oh look, it&#8217;s the product! How did the pig get trapped inside? No time to worry about that, he&#8217;s saved by a parrot on a trapeze! Another curtain, everybody bows! What was that commercial about?</p>
<h3>4) &#8220;Barney&#8217;s Cherry&#8221; by Thauka Kuki Team Entertainment (2012)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TjM9cEg2nbM?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Even after watching this film half a dozen times, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;ve quite &#8220;solved&#8221; it. This animation is very clearly a riddle on multiple levels. Firstly, there is the riddle presented via intertitles, which the viewer is given time to ponder before being presented with an answer. However, that answer doesn&#8217;t really satisfy, and it&#8217;s clear that there are visual clues throughout that point to the real solution (the very first titlescreen makes sure we know this).</p>
<p>But even after I figured out that (highlight to reveal spoilers) <span style="color: #ffffff;">Bonnie is cheating on Ed with Barney and actually wanted to free Barney, but was tricked by the statues watering the flowers</span>, I still don&#8217;t understand why the horses on the side of the screen turn into different animals at 0:47, why the characters spend so much time looking at the sword and cherry, or what random flashes of light are all about. But because the film is well animated and has a good score, I don&#8217;t mind revisiting it again and again.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning: the following films contain objectionable content</span></h2>
<h3>5) &#8220;A day in the life of&#8230;&#8221; by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/complessogasparo?feature=watch">Complesso Gasparo</a> (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vRNJCcnNvEQ?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Following the advice of a real-life chihuahua, a Fabuland monkey breaks the shackles of his buttoned-down life. He then proceeds to break-dance everywhere, deface a wall with obscene graffiti, take off his head, and attack a pig on a motorcycle.</p>
<h3>6) &#8220;The Franky Job&#8221; by David M Pickett (2007)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/WSApqbyCJM4?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>Rather than review my own film, I&#8217;m going to quote <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ZachMG">Zach Macias</a>&#8216; Bricks in Motion <a href="http://bricksinmotion.com/films/view/126/">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s essentially a noir private-eye film, but at its core is laced with hidden subtexts of racism and bigotry. The film is at times humorous, thought-provoking, and disturbing, mixed together in a blend that would seem abstract (and is for the most part), but seems to come together somehow at the end.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7) &#8220;Fabuland&#8221; by GrÃ©gory MÃ©tay et Olivier CouÃ«llant (2000)<br />
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OsZAu0Y_LBo?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></h3>
<p>This is the quintessential Fabuland animation and deserves 10 times as many views as it has. It features the most fully realized busy Fabuland town, and music and voice acting that perfectly fit the style of the characters. There&#8217;s a lot to admire here fromÂ  an animation perspective; the swaying palm trees are my personal favorite. Despite not knowing French, I felt like I understood the story perfectly thanks to the great visual storytelling. But why did I put this as the weirdest animation? Let&#8217;s just say it takes some very surprising turns.</p>
<h3>Honorable Mention: &#8220;<a href="http://brickzone.net/fabuland_housewives.html">The Fabuland Housewives</a>&#8221; by Mark Larson</h3>
<p><a href="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362" title="Fabuland Housewives by Mark Larson" alt="" src="http://brickanimation.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg" width="650" height="488" srcset="http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014.jpg 650w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-300x225.jpg 300w, http://setbump.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/fabuland_014-268x200.jpg 268w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a></p>
<p>Though not animated, this hilarious webcomic by Mark Larson is an impressive feat that must have taken countless hours to script, design, photograph, and code. Like the ABC show that inspired it, it is chock full of scandal, gruesome murders, and shocking twists. However, it&#8217;s also uproariously funny and well worth a read if you&#8217;ve got a few hours to kill.</p>
<p>So what do you think? Why are Fabuland animations so weird (or did I exaggerate how weird they are)? Are there any major works I missed?</p>

<p>The 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London may have ended last weekend, but you can relive the highlights in LEGO form, thanks to the Guardian&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;feature=plcp">Brick by Brick</a>&#8221; series of animations. While I am not a sports buff <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXEPnKSxGY&amp;feature=youtu.be">myself</a>, even I can appreciate the amount of work that went into creating these videos.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really interesting to me about &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; are the constraints under which it was produced. As outlined in the above behind-the-scenes video, nine animations were created by a small team in the span of two weeks. Because of <a href="http://kotaku.com/5933126/a-news-broadcast-reenacted-olympic-highlights-with-lego?tag=lego">broadcasting restrictions</a>, news organizations can&#8217;t in many cases show video footage of Olympics events, so these brick animations stand in for the video. Considered as a form of sports journalism, &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a delightful, creative solution to a frustrating problem. It&#8217;s also cool that brick animation has become so widely embraced that it gets casually integrated into the operations of a major news outlet.</p>
<p>However, when judged as examples of the brick animation form, these videos are less remarkable. The low frame rate (about 5 FPS by my eye) makes the animation look choppy, and a lot of time is killed showing still images. Again, this is understandable given the constraints, but still leaves little to recommend. Those interested in these animations only for the animation should stick to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzu-kb34ZYk&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video">highlights video</a> or the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lt5wB_xxyQ&amp;list=PL585F80EF639F5A4C&amp;index=9&amp;feature=plpp_video">gymnastics video</a>.</p>
<p>In stark contrast to &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/LEGOsports/videos">LEGO Sport Champions</a>,&#8221; one of the earliest examples of brick animation.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/U9u57UOh1Sc?rel=0" height="480" width="640" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Whereas &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; is a series of play-by-play recreations of real-life sports events, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; presents whimsical takes on traditional sports that frequently break the laws of physics. For example, in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv0kkgmPQgo&amp;feature=plcp">hockey short,</a> one of the players briefly turns into a snake, and the &#8220;winner&#8221; of the match is a dog from the audience. Rather than using minifigures, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; favors expressive, brick-built characters. While &#8220;Brick by Brick&#8221; features English narration to explain the action, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is voiceless, and features a strong score that responds to the action.</p>
<p>As an official series of animations commissioned by the LEGO group, &#8220;Sport Champions&#8221; is one of the few brick animations that can safely be said to take place in LEGOLAND*. It&#8217;s a place where animals and inanimate objects have as much agency as people do (the scoreboard wins the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST-tGPrltG4&amp;feature=plcp">gymnastics</a> competition), and where everything can be easily taken apart and recombined (when two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8Ln9hkXPlc&amp;feature=plcp">F1 racers</a> collide, their cars combine into a giant striped race car which they decide to co-pilot). I want to live there.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sports Champions&#8221; weightlifting video above is probably the one that comes closest to having a story. It follows a gorilla as it escapes from the circus and heads across town to investigate (and then compete in) a weight-lifting competition. In addition to giving a brief glimpse of some wonderful large scale town buildings, this video is chock-full of creative moments. For instance, when the two circus workers realize the gorilla has escaped, one of them turns into a dog to track its scent. The scenes in the massage room where the gorilla and masseur take turns molding each other into strange shapes are prime examples of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12_basic_principles_of_animation#Exaggeration">exaggeration</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>All seven of the &#8220;Sport Champion&#8221; videos are must-sees (and it will only take about half an hour to watch them all). Like the best brick animations, there is so much going on that you will want to watch them multiple times. Enjoy!</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m using LEGOLAND here in an anachronistic sense to refer to the <a href="http://www.peeron.com/catalogs/1982/medium/1/">fictional universe</a> that LEGO characters exist in, as opposed to the real-life theme parks with the same name.</p>
