		<description><![CDATA[David, you pointed out good aspects of online video contest and I agree with you.

(Note: Sorry for all the mistake, English is my second language. Thanks)

I&#039;ve show all top 5 finalists to my student for Halloween. I could see in their face what they liked the best in every video. They told me they liked my movie, but &quot;Monster in the closet&quot; make them laugh and smile much more. This movie deserved to win more than mines.

I had two movie in the top 5 into the ReBrick contest, not because my movies were the best, but because I&#039;ve ask all my friends to vote for me. &quot;The Zombies&quot; was online at the very beginning of the contest because I wanted to have more time to get votes (like you pointed out). My other movie, &quot;Monster SWAT&quot;, was finished and online juste a few days before the deadline... but I&#039;ve spend all the week-end asking my friends, one by one, to go vote for it. I must say I was feeling bad for others movie I was kicking out of the Top 5. Sadly, the rules didn&#039;t call for the best movie, but the most &quot;voted for&quot;. 

I&#039;m looking forward to participate to others contests, but if I ever win something, I want to win because I&#039;ve made a good movie, not because I had more friends willing to vote for me. Contest are great way to work on my animation skills and storytelling. I&#039;m happy that &quot;Monster in the closet&quot; won, because even my students like it better. Maybe we should ask them to be the jury on a contest? :-)

Happy brickfilming!

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I understand that the whole point of the contest was to drive traffic to ReBrick, but they definitely could have designed the contest better. They could have invited established ReBrick community members to assist with the judging and then opened it up to voting at the end. 

That&#039;s a really interesting point about which ones were uploaded to the YouTube channel. It definitely implies that someone at LEGO took the time to watch the videos and pick the best ones. It&#039;s a shame they didn&#039;t do that for the contest...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks David. I was really put off by their whole judging system. It probably was one way for the site to try and get more users by having the websites &#039;likes&#039; count instead of youtubes. Personally I think the worst thing about the competition was how not every video was considered by the judges. There wasn&#039;t that many so it wouldn&#039;t have taken long to review each one.

I also found it interesting how my video was one of 5 uploaded on the LEGO channel, yet I was not one of the 5 finalists in the actual competition.]]></description>
