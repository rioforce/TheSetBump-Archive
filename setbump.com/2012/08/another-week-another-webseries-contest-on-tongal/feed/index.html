		<description><![CDATA[One to keep in mind when talking about TLG is that it&#039;s a big company with lots of different departments, so when it does things that seem contradictory it might be because they are completely separate initiatives run by different people. I think they&#039;re experimenting with a lot of things. What ever else they&#039;ve done positive or negative, we have to give them due credit for the Super Hero Movie Maker App which is a huge boon for first-time animators.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but something seems weird about how TLG views brickfilms. I can&#039;t quite put a definition to it, but it seems like at times they greatly encourage the use of LEGO for animation, such as these Tongal contests, and sometimes to be almost against people spending a ton of money on their product for a hobby, not to mention all the free advertising on YouTube. And again, I may be off base here, but with what they&#039;re asking for from the winner, they don&#039;t seem all to aware of what goes into these magical animations that pop up on the internet, despite having worked with animators like David Pagano. Something has just always seemed strange to me, I don&#039;t know what it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only is the budget weird, but the project as a whole could end up being double the running time -- 8 episodes at 2 minutes each, or 16 minutes of animation total -- with a deadline of July 1, 2013. That&#039;s 16 minutes of animation in 10 months. Are they serious?

Even the 4 episode order has a super tough deadline, with around one month per 2-minute episode. All I can say is, good luck to whomever ends up winning this contest!]]></description>
