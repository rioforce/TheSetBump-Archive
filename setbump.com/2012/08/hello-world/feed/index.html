		<description><![CDATA[First I just wanted to say you guys are two of the very best lego animators out there at the moment. I was wondering if you would consider writing about what types of cameras/lenses you use for your brickfilms. Sharing this information would greatly help the next generation of up and coming Brickfilmers.

Thank you...... :)]]></description>
