		<description><![CDATA[You make a great point. One tendency that is common in high-FPS brick animations is to animate too many frames per action. This causes the characters in Dr. Jobs to seem &quot;floaty&quot; to me at certain times. 

My point in singling out these animations was precisely to draw attention to the way that pursuing &quot;realism&quot; with a higher FPS can lead to sacrifices in animation quality. There are some high-FPS brick animations that do it well. &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; immediately springs to mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What has been suggested above is that high frame rates = smooth and therefor better animation. More life like, hyper real. I totally disagree with this premise. Record nature movement with a video camera and lots of actions are very fast often occurring over only a few frames. Good animation does not equal high frame rates (imo).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very well said! Looking forward to that &quot;Good vs. realistic&quot; blog post ;)
I have to admit though that I really loved the main character raising his eyebrow just a tad, but maybe that&#039;s just me :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good discussion to have! &quot;How many frames per second did you use?&quot; is probably one of the top 3 questions I get asked about my videos (the other two being &quot;what camera do you use?&quot; and &quot;did you make this?&quot;).

The question people &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be asking is, &quot;what frame rate should I use on this particular film?&quot;, and I think the answer there is closely tied to another question: &quot;why am I making animated films?&quot; If your films are an outlet for you to experiment with super-slick graphics, then animating at 25+ fps might make sense. It&#039;s another way for you to attempt to improve the visual aspect of your craft. 

However, I think most successful filmmakers and animators make films because they want to tell memorable, compelling stories. In that sense, visuals are only one part of the language of cinema, and making sure all aspects of your film are on the same level as the picture is a balancing act in itself. 

&quot;The Machine&quot; has sharp visuals, but is not terribly noteworthy or memorable otherwise. Does the fact that the main character has an animated face make it easier to tell what he&#039;s thinking or doing? In this case, not really. His physical motion is smooth, but his movements are robotic; he walks in a straight line, turns, and then walks in a straight line again. Does that make his walk animation better or &quot;more realistic&quot; than a 12 fps walk cycle that bends and flows with human feeling? I would say no. 

Honestly, the thing I found most impressive about &quot;The Machine&quot; was the animation of the alarm clock being shut off; the offset plate that is hit and becomes a tile for a frame or two was a brilliant little touch. That alone was more interesting to me than coffee that looked like real fluid... which the guy then drank with stiff movements that didn&#039;t look anything like a living character drinking something.

&quot;Good&quot; vs. &quot;realistic&quot; in the world of animation is a whole other conversation -- perhaps one that warrants its own post. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a great point. Any FPS can be good if it used well. I should also mention that I have once ventured into 30 FPS for an animation that I felt needed it, so I&#039;m definitely not against high frame rates, I just think there should be really good justification for venturing into that realm.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that higher framerates &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; look really great, but it highly depends on the animator. The two films featured in this article are a great example - while I was really amazed by the smoothness of the first one, I got rather distracted by some of the animation in the second one which seemed really unnatural.
The first film executes the 25 fps almost perfectly, it adds really much to the film and makes it stand out with the love for the detail it shows in the animation. I animate at 15 fps because I know that with my resources I can&#039;t make the film look as good in 25 fps, in fact, it will look worse.
Not to devaluate the work btpro has put into his animation (it still is a great animation hands down!), but I think the same might apply to his video, some parts of it might have looked better in 15 fps.]]></description>
