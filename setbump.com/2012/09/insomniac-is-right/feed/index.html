		<description><![CDATA[I guess I felt like the flying effects didn&#039;t really blow me away. The minifig band is pretty static for the majority of the video -- I don&#039;t mean motion wise, but rather that they repetitively move their instruments along to the beat for the most part. When they take flight, they sort of just continue that repetition, but now with masking. 

I wanted to see more acting from the band members; the pianist/lead singer has some nice moments, but overall I didn&#039;t feel like the animation had too much variety. It felt almost more like motion graphics than character animation.

The trumpet players disappearing back into their instruments was pretty cool, though. :)]]></description>
