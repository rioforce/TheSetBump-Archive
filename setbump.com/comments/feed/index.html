		<description><![CDATA[Some neat stuff and good sound design. I agree with everything that&#039;s been said here.

(Also, note the irony of having the &quot;LEGO In Real Life&quot; title graphic as the only thing not made out of, er, LEGO in real life.)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you hit the nail on the head here. There aren&#039;t many other examples to compare it to, but I think Paint. by CheesyBricks managed to transcend the PES influence. However, I do find a close imitation less egregious when it&#039;s a style that is still barely explored in brickfilming. I would love to see them use this as a starting point and really come into their own with the concept in a future film, but as it stands it is a neat piece of work, especially the milk animation.]]></description>

Some of my favourite brickfilms with two guys in a living room are The White Ninja by Blunty, Money by Dave Wardell and Meatloaf by KG. Also, Out of Time goes without saying. Inspiration for Parallel Panic being a more adventurous dynamic duo film was taken from the Biff and Mario films by Dave Lennie and Andy Boyer, which don&#039;t have enough living room action to go on the list.]]></description>

I love how these rules are contradicted in the promotional image for this contest. (I guess the camera&#039;s field of view did crop out the hand moving the robot, but still.)]]></description>

I don’t have a great setup, cheap web cam and poor lighting, no back drop etc, and used the trial version of Stop Motion Pro to make sure it was good enough but the main thing is we had fun and my son is so excited to make another movie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What.  I truly have no legitimate response to this.  Honestly, this is just as bad as that time that Muslim group in Austria tried to claim that LEGO&#039;s Jabba&#039;s Palace set was racist and offensive to Muslims.

It&#039;s painfully obvious that Greenpeace are trying to appeal to people&#039;s emotions by making an excessively maudlin, heavy-handed and extremely unsubtle propaganda film based off-of a recent cinematic success to get people to rally against the big nasty greedy corporations who are killing off the poor polar bears.  &quot;Shell is polluting are kids&#039; imagination&quot;.  Just... what?  Is Shell brainwashing kids via LEGO now?  Should I start wearing a tinfoil hat while brickfilming?  Jokes aside, did they even WATCH The LEGO Movie?  Clearly the irony of using TLM as a basis for their crusade is totally lost on them.

I&#039;m actually confused what they&#039;re even protesting about since their petition is so hilariously vague.  How exactly is Shell &quot;polluting imagination&quot;, as they so histrionically put it?  As far as I know, Shell sets have been mainly promotional polybag-type things, and there haven&#039;t been any made for 15 years, as you pointed out.  The Ferrari sets were also limited in number and had nothing directly to do with Shell anyway (did they make the sets because Ferrari is partnered with an oil/gas corporation which very few if any of their target demographic would be interested in?  No, they made it because kids love racing cars.)  This just begs the question of why they&#039;re even picking on LEGO in the first place.  And if they&#039;re going to do it, why not provide some actual factual basis instead of blatantly trying to manipulate people&#039;s emotions in such a half-baked and cringeworthy manner.  The fact Greenpeace don&#039;t even have an apparent clear goal or half-way solid argument to back up their demagogic statements kills off any credibility they have.  Now all we need is a mob with torches and pitchforks besieging Billund (with the torches dipped in non-fossil fuel, naturally).  And finally, what do they even hope to achieve with this campaign?  Will Shell suddenly stop their allegedly unethical business practices because of this?  I highly doubt it.

OK, I probably went off on a massive rant there, but I&#039;m just getting sick and tired of constant fear-mongering with overly emotional messages that just turn me off.  (I&#039;m not even sure why I bothered with such a long post as Greenpeace are probably just trying to stir up controversy and grab attention with this campaign.)  A logical argument backed up with solid facts and reputable research would be much more convincing, but apparently, despite all of humanity&#039;s achievements we still have a limited capacity for rational thought...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with your “Yellow 4×2 Flat” rating. The actual story was dull and there were too many &quot;Look! We can take apart and rebuild ourselves and our world at will!&quot; jokes. But I did enjoy the &quot;decal&quot; joke and I found all of the cameos and inside jokes hidden in the background a lot more amusing than than most of the front and center jokes.

The LEGO Movie cast a long shadow and definitely made the Simpsons episode look worse in comparison, both in terms of story, jokes and visual appeal (I was quite bothered that the digital LEGO was a pretty poor representation of the actual pieces).

I did like seeing the classic LEGO pirates. I wish The LEGO Movie had included more classic LEGO references beyond Benny and Classic Space.]]></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I agree with your “Yellow 4×2 Flat” rating. The actual story was dull and there were too many &#8220;Look!

There was good reference for AFOL (The LEGO wooden duck toy in the church), but way less than I expected. I bet some brickfilmer will do better stuff on YouTube now that the Simpsons&#039;s minifigs are out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment Nathan! Glad you&#039;re enjoying my writing.

I see where you&#039;re coming from with your comment about the structure of my posts. I&#039;m the kind of person who likes to read reviews of movies before I go and see them so that I can have a critical framework in place to dissect them as I watch, so I naturally write my articles that way. But I can see why other people wouldn&#039;t enjoy that. I&#039;ll keep your comment in mind as I write future articles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely agree on your comments about Keshen&#039;s video. Your &quot;moving like molasses&quot; description is perfect. I actually was squirming, impatient, as the video progressed. I also agree entirely with David&#039;s comments. When I returned to brickfilming, I binged on a lot of brickfilms and decided to experiment more with exaggerated animation. Previously when I animated I took a more measured approach, but now I attempt a more exaggerated, bouncy look where appropriate, such as during the Half-Life video game sequence in Alex and Derrick: Five Years Later.

I have suggestion on how you might word future &quot;compare and contrast&quot; opinion pieces I&#039;ve seen from you recently. I enjoy these posts a lot, and I know it&#039;s your own opinion that you are presenting, but I would suggest less leading language when introducing the films. I came to the same conclusion as you when I viewed both films, but I do feel like my opinion and experience was effected a bit when watching Addicted to You. I watched expecting to see the slow, sluggish animation, instead of observing it for myself. Simply putting both videos near the top of the post would solve this issue.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here are some samples of real lego movies: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNc3Av9SQhE
I personally think that making a 3d animation of the Lego movie removes its true essence. 
I have this epic idea of remaking the whole &quot;Lego Movie&quot; in actual Legos. 
This will take time but I think it will be an awesome worldwide collaboration!
What do you think? 
Lets collaborate. All Lego stopmotion animators using real legos.
Each participating animators will be given specific scenes. 
Are you up for this challenge real lego stopmotion animators? 
Contact me and lets collaborate.

	&lt;li&gt;I&#039;ve studied animation, LEGO, and stop-motion for 20+ years, and therefore know what stop-motion looks like when I see it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;CG is not yet photoreal enough to pass as stop-motion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Anecdotes from the filmmakers are not evidence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All of the behind-the-scenes of The LEGO Movie released thus far feature exclusively CG animation craft and techniques&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The folks who wrote the aforementioned articles about The LEGO Movie trailer did, in fact, jump the gun by calling the film stop-motion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&#160;
I will concede that the snarky tone of this blog post is, in itself, not terribly productive. Now that a bunch of new behind-the-scenes videos have come out, I&#039;ll write a more constructive follow-up.

If you&#039;ve got other sources or things to contribute to the discussion (beyond just casting aspersions), we&#039;d love to check them out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love your review, good job David. I&#039;ll go see it again tomorrow and I&#039;ll try to catch that Magic Portal reference. 

Can&#039;t wait to own the DVD! (like you). 

As a father... I got the point of the movie. I&#039;m always keeping my kids away from my studio so they don&#039;t destroy my setup, but thankfully, I&#039;m not Lord Business. They have plenty of LEGO (well, Hero Factory and Duplo) and we play together a lot. Never the less, that part was a message to me (to be careful about how I deal with LEGO and my kids).

And... as a father again... I really know what &quot;We are from planet Duplo and we came to destroy you&quot; means. :-D]]></description>

The movie was so touching that my kid could not help but crying, and of course, there was lots of laughing also. BTW, now I can explain to him why the Lord Business has super-tall legs. ^^]]></description>

I would argue that LEGO Universe wins at un-synergy.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the critique. I always enjoy reading these kind of things, and it makes me especially happy when someone brings up how terribly poor TLG&#039;s stories are vs. their timeless products (Bionicle being an exception). Fortunately, it looks like the LEGO movie is going to break the ice. Kevin Ulrich saw a preview screening and already gave it his praise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I totally missed including a couple of well done and popular brickfilm recreated movie trailers.  

Cable28&#039;s Iron Man 3 Trailer #1: IN LEGO has over a million views on YouTube and is definitely worth viewing.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJhL0Ihw_UM

And how could I not include Keshen8&#039;s Ninja Assassin Trailer that has over 1.6 million views.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycAY7vVpzNc

		<description><![CDATA[I agree it&#039;s a great time to animate!  I used to make animations with that old Steven Spielberg Moviemaker set, and I loved it!  But now, with even more technology and great software and great quality webcams for a low price, anyone can animate!  I know I wouldn&#039;t have been able to make my lego-movie without the new technology :)

Does anyone happen to have a must-see list of Lego animations?  The only ones I&#039;ve seen that I would consider legitimate short-films are Lindsay Flea&#039;s &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; and Maxime Marion&#039;s &quot;Droits d’auteur&quot;.  As much as I enjoy watching little lego comedy sketches by people like Keshen8 and SpastikChuwawa, sometimes I want a little bit more substance :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When the first LEGO Tongal contest appeared I thought it was interesting. The fact that they were offering cash prizes seemed like an improvement over their old contests which mostly offered LEGO sets as prizes. But now that Tongal contests have become part of the status quo for promoting new LEGO themes it seems much more like exploitation than giving back to the community.

Contrast this with the LEGO Nicktoons contest from 2008 (which David and I tied for second place in). The parameters were much more open ended (basically just a 2 minute time limit), we all kept the rights to our films, our films got distributed on a major outlet (Comcast OnDemand) and the Grand Prize winner was then commissioned to make an animation for LEGO and Nickelodeon (Spongebob&#039;s &quot;Don&#039;t be a jerk, it&#039;s Christmas&quot;).

Really great diverse films came out of the Nicktoons contest, if it had been a Tongal contest for Spongebob, we would have gotten a bunch of Spongebob animations, which is less exciting. Both Garret Barati and David Pagano got noticed by LEGO through contests and then were given opportunities for actual paid work. This doesn&#039;t seem to be what the Tongal contests will lead to.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There has been a lot of competitions and big $ thrown at Tongal by TLG. I&#039;ve even entered a few myself. It is interesting that you end this article questioning the degree of exploitation.
This is something I&#039;ve been thinking about and have since decided not to be part of these competitions any more.

IMO it is very poor form by TLG, which is a billion $ company, to use services like this to get very high quality results for next to nothing. There is so many restrictions on the entries now that the mold is set for what they want. If they know what they want they should support the industry and pay for it.

Not well played LEGO.]]></description>

<p>IMO it is very poor form by TLG, which is a billion $ company, to use services like this to get very high quality results for next to nothing. There is so many restrictions on the entries now that the mold is set for what they want. If they know what they want they should support the industry and pay for it.</p>
<p>Not well played LEGO.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Delighted to have this as our first guest post! I couldn&#039;t agree more with the sentiment. 

I feel very lucky to have been born when I did. I was lucky that my family had a camcorder when I was a kid, which is what I used to make my first LEGO videos. They were just really starting to drop in price and become widely available around then. 

YouTube also launched right when I was in college so I was able to start building an audience then. Thinking about YouTube distribution really affected how I wrote and filmed The Nightly News at Nine. 

Yay for the modern era!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s nice to see a different take on this discussion.  I agree; I think the main problem here is that as the technology has become cheaper and more accessible and the rise of YouTube, many more people are making and releasing mediocre brickfilms--making it harder to find the good work.  But that doesn&#039;t mean there aren&#039;t any big, high quality films being made (France &#038; Alex&#039;s &quot;Bestia&quot;, your highlighting of &quot;Bound&quot;, NickDurron&#039;s Kickstarter pitch for &quot;Melting Point&quot;, and Squid&#039;s Batman Brickfilm all come to mind).  Not only that, but there are some great new animators out there (Brotherhood Workshop, though to be fair, they&#039;ve mostly released LotR-based shorts, but very high-quality and funny ones at that) and old, &quot;retired&quot; animators are coming back (Nathan Wells).

If anything, this is good news, as Brickfilming is now becoming more popular and recognised as a hobby.  Hopefully new animators will in time become better and release longer, higher quality films.  I myself have only just begun and still have much to learn.

One issue I think, though, is creativity.  The brickfilms that become the most popular are invariably based on licensed themes (Star Wars, Batman, etc.) or existing material (such Insomniac&#039;s music videos).  The bulk of the work produced by the most famous/popular brickfilmers (ForrestFire, Keshen, Brotherhood Workshop) especially follows this trend.  Fancypants&#039; most popular video is a lightsaber duel.  Even Michael Hickox tends to tap into the average person&#039;s perception of LEGO--as a children&#039;s toy, telling stories in a simple, almost nostalgic way.  There&#039;s nothing inherently wrong with this (Insomniac&#039;s music videos are incredible, The Force Unleashed is rightly a textbook case on how to film a fight scene, Brotherhood&#039;s films are hilarious and well executed, and your own &quot;Don&#039;t Blink&quot; film was very nicely done) but it does point to a tendency to rely on other people&#039;s creativity to get popular.  It&#039;s to a certain extent understandable--using something popular and recognizable (like Batman) will reach a much larger audience (I suspect this is why Superman and Batman are going to be in The LEGO Movie...), but it makes original, stand-alone stories told using LEGO as the medium much more difficult to bring to a larger audience.  I doubt many outside of the brickfilming community are familiar with, say, &quot;The Citizen of the Year&quot;, &quot;The Call of Farqunglu&quot;, &quot;Zombie: Genesis&quot;, &quot;Unrenewable&quot;, &quot;Copyright&quot;, or &quot;Pirates Rule!&quot;; which is a shame, as these sort of films are by far more interesting than a short clip of Batman fighting Stormtroopers.  Sadly, all this will most likely encourage most brickfilmers to make clips about licensed characters, instead of creating their own unique stories.

Well, I went a bit off-topic there, sorry for the overlong post.  I enjoyed this article; it&#039;s nice to see a different writer on The Set Bump!  (Not that I have anything against Pickett and Pagano, of course!)]]></description>

As I was drafting the article I immediately thought of his film when I came to the portion about the &quot;golden age&quot;. We must remember to take what we have today and use it.

Also, great point about the LEGO Movie! It&#039;ll be exciting to see what happens.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is more and more brickfilms on the internet, that&#039;s for sure. But considering the age and the goal of many new brickfilmers, I would say that The LEGO Group reaches its target: young boy 5 to 12 years old.

Those kids publish every 2 sec of animation they do and they are so proud of it. That&#039;s the way people learns: by trying. So, I wouldn&#039;t say their is a bunch of bad brickfilms on internet, I prefer to say that their a lot of people out there trying and learning, becoming better movies after movies. That&#039;s how I started and I can tell you that&#039;s how every great film maker started.

 Jackson, this blog post is awesome and I agree with you. :-)]]></description>

Personally I think that when the new Lego Movie comes out it&#039;ll draw more people to watch brickfilms. Is it just me or do legos seem to becoming cooler to the world as time goes by

		<description><![CDATA[Obviously the more brickfilm there are, the more mediocre brickfilms there are. (And therefore more good brickfilms too.)
Just like you I don&#039;t think this is a bad time for brickfilming.
And with &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; coming we should expect more newcomers in brickfilming, it&#039;s not going to stop now.
To those who says that the golden age is over, I&#039;d tell them to watch Loïc F-B&#039;s &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;, which fits pretty well to the situation.
Everyone has its own &quot;golden age&quot;, in a few year brickfilmers will look back at 2013 and think that this was the golden age.
Isaac Asimov wrote an interesting essay about that.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ah, why do all of the brickfilming conventions and festivals take place in the USA?  For those of us living Across the Pond (or anywhere else in the world for that matter) this is a rather unfortunate set of circumstances.  Alas, I lack the disposable income to make the epic journey to North Carolina (and unfortunately I don&#039;t think I could convince anyone that funding said journey would be a worthwhile cause).

Anyway, I noticed that the playlist had some films on it made by people who didn&#039;t attend (or weren&#039;t on the Q&#038;A panel)--does this mean you can submit your films even if you don&#039;t attend in person?]]></description>

<p>Anyway, I noticed that the playlist had some films on it made by people who didn&#8217;t attend (or weren&#8217;t on the Q&amp;A panel)&#8211;does this mean you can submit your films even if you don&#8217;t attend in person?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I was pleasantly surprised by the animation style, for a minute I thought maybe there was some actual stop-motion going on. I fully expect this to be a thoroughly enjoyable romp. 

The prominence of the licensed characters gives me pause. But given the failure of LEGO Universe, I guess we can&#039;t blame them for eschewing a LEGO-specific mythos...

I am happy to see a black minifig co-existing with yellow minifigs for the first time since Cloud City. If I can&#039;t buy that Morgan Freeman minifig, I will be very disappointed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the new name. :-)

Sometime, when I &quot;bump&quot; my set/camera/everything, I don&#039;t see it right away or I decide to continue with the shot (for whatever reasons). We should do a mashup of every sequence, published of not, that have a bump in it. Could be fun to... cry about all those accident&quot;

Long live The Set Bump!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I get the feeling these shot-for-shot LEGO remakes are only going to become more common. Making a LEGO video of this one in particular is a great fit; not just because of the song, but because there&#039;s upwards of a dozen different Rupert Grint minifigures. 

The shaky-cam gets a bit distracting at times, but there&#039;s some neat stuff going on this video, especially set-wise. I just wish we could see it in full-screen and not as a side-by-side composite deal.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never had a chance to check out &quot;LEGO: The Time Machine&quot; until just now, and I have to say, it&#039;s pretty great! As Sir Glub mentioned, the story line and pacing of the film is engaging enough to keep your attention in spite of the more basic stop-motion craft skills. 

And the sets are great! I love the future scene (obviously).

Personally, I&#039;d rather have a film keep my attention at less than 100% animation quality than see a super-slick movie with a lame, boring story -- and the former is what we&#039;ve got here. Well done.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, I&#039;m certainly honored that you featured this on your blog!

I had seen both &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; and &quot;GO MINIMAN GO&quot; prior to making this, and the latter, in particular, did probably serve as a big inspiration though I tried to give my film a different focus.  I made this for a contest, the theme of which was &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, which is why I chose this idea.

Looking over it now, I see several areas for improvement, but given the time span (I had just over a month to make this) and my general inexperience with stop-motion I&#039;m quite pleased with how it turned out.  I did end up re-shooting the Egypt scene as it was extremely flickery, but I&#039;m not sure why it ended up still having loads of flicker despite my best efforts.

Incidentally, I had originally considered using different snippets of music for different scenes (for example, the Egypt scene was supposed to have the Slavonic March, and the pirate/explorer scene the Ride of the Valkyries), and Also Sprach Zarathustra was supposed to be used for the climax, but unfortunately I ran out of time and had to go with a single piece of music.

I certainly intend to continue brickfilming, though at this moment I&#039;m extremely busy. Still, I&#039;ve got several story ideas and am working on scripting, and I hope to work on some projects over the summer!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a History teacher and a brickfilmer, I love Go Miniman Go. It&#039;s awesome. The Time machine is good too, but need to learn and practice some technics. I think the brickfilmer community need an online class or something to share the basis. I know, there are come post on forums, video and blogs... but they are sometime hard to find or understand. 

People spend so much time on their brickfilm, it&#039;s sad when it come out with lightflicker or shaky cam when it&#039;s an easy thing to fix... if you know about it. I&#039;m working on a BrickFilm Workshop, but it will be in French (as it is not easy for me to write in English). BrickSet had put a lots of reviews about LEGO sets together, maybe the new BrickAnimator can pull together all the ressources about brickfilm in one place? :-)

The time machine commands a lot of respect and I wish they continue brickfilming, they can only improve with time, experiences and... some advice :-)]]></description>

It really is amazing that they can turn out so many stop-motion videos so quickly and have a generally high quality to them.

		<description><![CDATA[Mighty Wanderer- You bring up some excellent questions. Here are some options you may want to consider:

1) You and your family might want to think about just attending Brickworld Chicago as public attendees on either Saturday or Sunday. You won’t be able to enter the contest, but you will be able to meet David and I (and other animators present) and watch the animations (we’ll have them playing on a loop during the public hours, in addition to showing them on Saturday evening for the festival screening). You’ll also be able to see all the cool LEGO exhibits.

2) All Access Registrants can attend the film festival screening on Saturday night.]]></description>

Just in case you haven&#039;t noticed it (although I doubt it), this is a great new animation of Bionnicle28 which I in my opinion worth sharing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7o6ERhuEN4 Keep up the great work &#039;brickanimation.com&#039;!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[David, you pointed out good aspects of online video contest and I agree with you.

(Note: Sorry for all the mistake, English is my second language. Thanks)

I&#039;ve show all top 5 finalists to my student for Halloween. I could see in their face what they liked the best in every video. They told me they liked my movie, but &quot;Monster in the closet&quot; make them laugh and smile much more. This movie deserved to win more than mines.

I had two movie in the top 5 into the ReBrick contest, not because my movies were the best, but because I&#039;ve ask all my friends to vote for me. &quot;The Zombies&quot; was online at the very beginning of the contest because I wanted to have more time to get votes (like you pointed out). My other movie, &quot;Monster SWAT&quot;, was finished and online juste a few days before the deadline... but I&#039;ve spend all the week-end asking my friends, one by one, to go vote for it. I must say I was feeling bad for others movie I was kicking out of the Top 5. Sadly, the rules didn&#039;t call for the best movie, but the most &quot;voted for&quot;. 

I&#039;m looking forward to participate to others contests, but if I ever win something, I want to win because I&#039;ve made a good movie, not because I had more friends willing to vote for me. Contest are great way to work on my animation skills and storytelling. I&#039;m happy that &quot;Monster in the closet&quot; won, because even my students like it better. Maybe we should ask them to be the jury on a contest? :-)

Happy brickfilming!

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, I understand that the whole point of the contest was to drive traffic to ReBrick, but they definitely could have designed the contest better. They could have invited established ReBrick community members to assist with the judging and then opened it up to voting at the end. 

That&#039;s a really interesting point about which ones were uploaded to the YouTube channel. It definitely implies that someone at LEGO took the time to watch the videos and pick the best ones. It&#039;s a shame they didn&#039;t do that for the contest...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks David. I was really put off by their whole judging system. It probably was one way for the site to try and get more users by having the websites &#039;likes&#039; count instead of youtubes. Personally I think the worst thing about the competition was how not every video was considered by the judges. There wasn&#039;t that many so it wouldn&#039;t have taken long to review each one.

I also found it interesting how my video was one of 5 uploaded on the LEGO channel, yet I was not one of the 5 finalists in the actual competition.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whoohoohoo... ReBrick use one of my movie for the contest AND it&#039;s on BrickAnimation.com. I&#039;m an happy man. 

Funny thing is, I&#039;ve ask ReBrick if I can participate (having my movie as an example) and they said Yes as long as I submit a new movie! So I did with &quot;The Zombies&quot;. 

Funny thing n. 2: They will choose a winner from the top 5... and for now we are only 4 participants. So, come on everybody, submit your movies!

		<description><![CDATA[You make a great point. One tendency that is common in high-FPS brick animations is to animate too many frames per action. This causes the characters in Dr. Jobs to seem &quot;floaty&quot; to me at certain times. 

My point in singling out these animations was precisely to draw attention to the way that pursuing &quot;realism&quot; with a higher FPS can lead to sacrifices in animation quality. There are some high-FPS brick animations that do it well. &quot;The Magic Portal&quot; immediately springs to mind.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What has been suggested above is that high frame rates = smooth and therefor better animation. More life like, hyper real. I totally disagree with this premise. Record nature movement with a video camera and lots of actions are very fast often occurring over only a few frames. Good animation does not equal high frame rates (imo).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good discussion to have! &quot;How many frames per second did you use?&quot; is probably one of the top 3 questions I get asked about my videos (the other two being &quot;what camera do you use?&quot; and &quot;did you make this?&quot;).

The question people &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be asking is, &quot;what frame rate should I use on this particular film?&quot;, and I think the answer there is closely tied to another question: &quot;why am I making animated films?&quot; If your films are an outlet for you to experiment with super-slick graphics, then animating at 25+ fps might make sense. It&#039;s another way for you to attempt to improve the visual aspect of your craft. 

However, I think most successful filmmakers and animators make films because they want to tell memorable, compelling stories. In that sense, visuals are only one part of the language of cinema, and making sure all aspects of your film are on the same level as the picture is a balancing act in itself. 

&quot;The Machine&quot; has sharp visuals, but is not terribly noteworthy or memorable otherwise. Does the fact that the main character has an animated face make it easier to tell what he&#039;s thinking or doing? In this case, not really. His physical motion is smooth, but his movements are robotic; he walks in a straight line, turns, and then walks in a straight line again. Does that make his walk animation better or &quot;more realistic&quot; than a 12 fps walk cycle that bends and flows with human feeling? I would say no. 

Honestly, the thing I found most impressive about &quot;The Machine&quot; was the animation of the alarm clock being shut off; the offset plate that is hit and becomes a tile for a frame or two was a brilliant little touch. That alone was more interesting to me than coffee that looked like real fluid... which the guy then drank with stiff movements that didn&#039;t look anything like a living character drinking something.

&quot;Good&quot; vs. &quot;realistic&quot; in the world of animation is a whole other conversation -- perhaps one that warrants its own post. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that higher framerates &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; look really great, but it highly depends on the animator. The two films featured in this article are a great example - while I was really amazed by the smoothness of the first one, I got rather distracted by some of the animation in the second one which seemed really unnatural.
The first film executes the 25 fps almost perfectly, it adds really much to the film and makes it stand out with the love for the detail it shows in the animation. I animate at 15 fps because I know that with my resources I can&#039;t make the film look as good in 25 fps, in fact, it will look worse.
Not to devaluate the work btpro has put into his animation (it still is a great animation hands down!), but I think the same might apply to his video, some parts of it might have looked better in 15 fps.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but something seems weird about how TLG views brickfilms. I can&#039;t quite put a definition to it, but it seems like at times they greatly encourage the use of LEGO for animation, such as these Tongal contests, and sometimes to be almost against people spending a ton of money on their product for a hobby, not to mention all the free advertising on YouTube. And again, I may be off base here, but with what they&#039;re asking for from the winner, they don&#039;t seem all to aware of what goes into these magical animations that pop up on the internet, despite having worked with animators like David Pagano. Something has just always seemed strange to me, I don&#039;t know what it is.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First I just wanted to say you guys are two of the very best lego animators out there at the moment. I was wondering if you would consider writing about what types of cameras/lenses you use for your brickfilms. Sharing this information would greatly help the next generation of up and coming Brickfilmers.

Thank you...... :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I felt like the flying effects didn&#039;t really blow me away. The minifig band is pretty static for the majority of the video -- I don&#039;t mean motion wise, but rather that they repetitively move their instruments along to the beat for the most part. When they take flight, they sort of just continue that repetition, but now with masking. 

I wanted to see more acting from the band members; the pianist/lead singer has some nice moments, but overall I didn&#039;t feel like the animation had too much variety. It felt almost more like motion graphics than character animation.

The trumpet players disappearing back into their instruments was pretty cool, though. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comments, everyone! There are some cool entries so far. 

One thing to keep in mind is that the ideal name should evoke equal parts &quot;LEGO&quot; and &quot;film/animation&quot; -- not one or the other -- which I know makes things a little trickier.

Keep the ideas coming!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not only is the budget weird, but the project as a whole could end up being double the running time -- 8 episodes at 2 minutes each, or 16 minutes of animation total -- with a deadline of July 1, 2013. That&#039;s 16 minutes of animation in 10 months. Are they serious?

Even the 4 episode order has a super tough deadline, with around one month per 2-minute episode. All I can say is, good luck to whomever ends up winning this contest!]]></description>

Oh, and if you excuse the shameless self-promotion, I used it as a stylistic element on a part of a short animation as well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXqDmGorNLY

		<description><![CDATA[Really nice, brings back memories... This is one of the first Brickfilms I ever saw, despite the fact it was already 2008 or so by then.

Keep those reviews coming, very good reads so far!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Blatant self-promotion - ROBOTA was a big inspiration for the style of my short &quot;Orange Beats Binary&quot; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FZJ5DMhnyM 
The scale of the characters, the monochromatic setting with occasional bursts of color, the dialogue-free story, and even a silly song featuring a female vocalist are all homages to this masterpiece. In summary, nothing I do is original :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What&#039;s interesting, too, is that this is one of the few LEGO animations to have a full-on alternate ending that was completely animated. I wonder if it was a case of LEGO/Marvel/Sony not approving this first one after animation was already done...?
